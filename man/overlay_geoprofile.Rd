\title{Add geoprofile to dynamic map}
\usage{
overlay_geoprofile(myplot, project, K = NULL, source = NULL,
  threshold = 0.1, col = col_hotcold(), opacity = 0.8,
  smoothing = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{myplot}{dynamic map produced by \code{plot_map()} function}

\item{project}{an RgeoProfile project, as produced by the function 
\code{rgeoprofile_project()}}

\item{K}{which value of K to plot}

\item{source}{which source to plot. If NULL then plot combined surface}

\item{threshold}{what proportion of geoprofile to plot}

\item{col}{set of plotting colours}

\item{opacity}{opacity of geoprofile (that is not invisible due to being
below threshold)}

\item{smoothing}{what level of smoothing to apply to geoprofile. Smoothing is
applied using the \code{raster} function \code{disaggregate}, with
\code{method = "bilinear"}}
}
