```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(10)
library(silverblaze)

## Introduction

The following tutorial will introduce the user to the general structure required to run silverblaze when analysing point pattern data. The protocol of silverblaze is to create one fundamental object, referred to in these tutorials as `p`, that describes the entire project. The structure of `p` consists of:

1. The data used to run the model
2. The parameter settings for the model
3. The output of running the model

Following this, the user will learn how to plot and diagnose the output of the model.

## Simulating data

We start by defining area over which we are simulating our data.

```{r}
lon_range <- c(-0.2,0)
lat_range <- c(51.45, 51.55)
```

We can generate our data from a given model using `sim_data()`.

```{r}
mysim <- sim_data(data_type = "point-pattern",
                  K = 2,
                  dispersal_model = "normal", 
                  sigma_model = "single",
                  sigma_mean = 0.5,
                  sigma_var = 0,
                  N = 150,      
                  source_lon_min = lon_range[1],
                  source_lon_max = lon_range[2],
                  source_lat_min = lat_range[1],
                  source_lat_max = lat_range[2])

true_source <- mysim$record$true_source
```

These parameters describe the underlying behaviour of the data in question:

* `data_type` is the data we wish to generate, in this case, point-pattern.
* `K` is the number of sources with which individuals are spatially based.
* `dispersal_model` tells us which dispersal kernel to use to generate the data.
* `sigma_model` defines homogeneity or independence of dispersal across sources.
* `sigma_mean` and `sigma_var` govern the dispersal associated with each source. Set `sigma_var = 0` to set an explicit dispersal via `sigma_mean`.
* `N` tells us how many individuals we there are over our search area. 

Let's view our point-pattern data.

```{r}
head(mysim$data)
```

Here we see the general structure of the data required to run the finite mixture model. That is, a collection of points in decimal longitude and latitude formate. This `mysim$data` object is the only piece of information required for the user to run the model. All other output from `mysim$data` is merely a consequence of simulating the data in the first place.

## Creating a project

We initialise a blank project `p` using the `rgeoprofile_project()` function.

```{r}
p <- rgeoprofile_project()
```

We then add in our simulated data using `bind_data()`.

```{r}
p <- bind_data(p,
               df = mysim$data,
               data_type = "point-pattern")
```

## Simple spatial prior

We wish to impose a spatial prior on our model. Here we implement a very simple one by instructing the model to restrict the area of interest to to that which contains our points plus some `guard_rail`. We can produce a uniform spatial prior with `raster_grid()`.

```{r}
uniform_prior <- raster_grid(range_lon = c(-0.2, 0), 
                             range_lat = c(51.45, 51.55),
                             cells_lon = 100, 
                             cells_lat = 100, 
                             guard_rail = 0.1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
spatialProject <- p
spatialProject <- new_set(project = spatialProject,
                          spatial_prior = uniform_prior)

plot_spatial <- plot_map()
plot_spatial <- overlay_spatial_prior(plot_spatial, spatialProject, col = "red", opacity = 0.2)
plot_spatial
```

## Parameter sets

Next we define the various priors on the variables we wish to estimate when running the model. We define these parameters via `new_set()`. Notice the project `p` is one of the function's arguments. This is such that the parameter set we define is added into our project.

```{r}
p <- new_set(project = p,
             spatial_prior = uniform_prior,
             dispersal_model = "normal",
             sigma_model = "single",
             sigma_prior_mean = 0.5,
             sigma_prior_sd = 2,
             name = "Tutorial Parameters")
p
```

The project `p` is now taking shape as we have defined the data and parameters for the model. Each time the `new_set()` function is run it will add a new set of parameters to `p$parameters_sets` and will regard this new set as the `active_set`. To delete an old parameter set, we use `delete_set()`. The `"output"` object within `p` is empty right now, but will be populated once the model has run.

## Running the model

We are now ready to run the MCMC algorithm on our data. The arguments in `run_mcmc()` are similar to many other MCMC implementations. The algorithm will start in the burn-in phase, checking for convergence at each `convergence_test` iterations and move into the sample phase once the conditions for convergence have been met or the number of burn-in iterations has been reached. The argument `K` governs how many sources the model should search for. Although we simulated the data, and know the true underlying number of sources, this will rarely be the case with a real-world data set. Hence `K` can take a single value or a sequence of values. We choose `1:5` as our data was generated with three sources. The `pb_markdown = TRUE` argument ensures a neater version of the console output is printed below, this should be removed when run by you.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
K_model <- 1:5
beta_list <- list()
n_rungs <- rep(NA, length(K_model))

for(i in K_model){
  beta_k <- silverblaze::: optimise_beta(proj = p, 
                                         K = i, 
                                         create_maps = FALSE,
                                         target_acceptance = 0.5, 
                                         max_iterations = 20,
                                         beta_init = seq(0, 1, l = 5), 
                                         silent = FALSE,
                                         burnin = 1e1,
                                         samples = 10,
                                         converge_test = 1e1,
                                         coupling_on = TRUE, 
                                         pb_markdown = FALSE)
  
  beta_list[[i]] <- beta_k$beta_vec[length(beta_k$beta_vec)]
  n_rungs[i] <- length(unlist(beta_list[[i]]))
}

#------------------------------------------------------------------

# RUN MCMC
for(i in K_model){

  beta_vals <- unlist(beta_list[[i]])

  p <- run_mcmc(project = p,
                K = i,
                rungs = length(beta_list[[i]]),
                coupling_on = TRUE,
                burnin = 5e3,
                samples = 5e3,
                converge_test = 1000,
                auto_converge = TRUE,
                beta_manual = beta_vals,
                pb_markdown = FALSE)

}



p <- run_mcmc(project = p,
              K = 1:5,
              burnin = 4e4,
              samples = 1e4,
              converge_test = 1e4,
              auto_converge = TRUE,
              pb_markdown = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p <- rgeoprofile_file("point_pattern_project.rds")
```

Before plotting any geoprofiles let's makes sure the MCMC is indeed mixing well.

## Diagnosing the model

Firstly we question the MCMC's ability by producing diagnostic plots of the log-likelihood. This can be done for each value of `K` to ensure the algorithm is behaving properly.

```{r}
plot_loglike_diagnostic(p, K = 2)
```

Another useful metric for assessing the MCMC is its effective sampling size (ESS). If we have 10,000 sampling iterations but an ESS of 80 then we really only have 80 samples from the posterior, and so we should run it out for longer.

```{r}
get_output(p, name = "ESS", K = 2, type = "summary")
```

## Results
### Mapping

Now the model has run, we can start to visualise different aspects of the project. Plotting objects in silverblaze follow a similar structure to [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). We start with a base layer

```{r}
plot1 <- plot_map()
```

and overlay different parts of our project using the set of overlay functions. Lets start with the underlying sources locations and our spatial prior.

```{r}
plot2 <- overlay_spatial_prior(plot1, p, col = "red", opacity = 0.2)
plot2 <- overlay_sources(plot2, true_source$longitude, true_source$latitude)
plot2
```

This isn't too interesting yet, so let's add to this the point-pattern data.

```{r}
plot3 <- overlay_points(plot2, 
                        lon = mysim$data$longitude,
                        lat = mysim$data$latitude,
                        col = "purple")
plot3
```

Finally, we add in the geoprofile produced by running the MCMC.

```{r}
plot4 <- overlay_geoprofile(plot3, 
                            project = p, 
                            threshold = 0.1, 
                            opacity = 0.8, 
                            K = 3, 
                            col = plasma, 
                            legend = TRUE)
plot4
```

### Other Parameter Estimation

We can also plot the posterior 95% credible intervals of each sigma. The `"single"` model will produce a single interval. Note the true value of 0.5 km.

```{r}
plot_sigma(p, K = 2)
```

The model-testing metric used consistently through the geographic profiling literature is the hitscore. This is calculated by computing the area searched before finding a source divided by the total search area (where a search is defined by starting at the top of the geoprofile and working your way down). Hence a lower hitscore indicates a better performing model. We use `get_hitscores` to produce these.

```{r}
hs <- get_hitscores(p, true_source$longitude, true_source$latitude, ring_search = FALSE)
hs
```

Another common metric to use for this analysis is a gini coefficient from a Lorenz plot.

```{r}
plot_lorenz(hs)
```

This `plot_lorenz()` function returns a graph that describes the number of sources found as a function of area searched. The Gini co-efficient is then calculated as the area under these piecewise curves.

```{r}
gini(hs)
```

Both the `gini()` and `get_hitscores()` functions refer to a "ringsearch" strategy. This is used to compare the model to a naive search strategy that requires you to search radially outwards from each positive sentinel site until sources are found. This gives us a bottom line non-trivial search strategy to compare hitscores to.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# secretly save/load data from file so output is consistent between tutorials
# saveRDS(mysim, file = "/home/mstevens/Desktop/MAIN WORK/Presence Absence/Package Versions/silverblaze/inst/extdata/tutorial2_mysim.rds")
# saveRDS(p, file = "/home/mstevens/Desktop/MAIN WORK/Presence Absence/Package Versions/silverblaze/inst/extdata/point_pattern_project.rds")
# saveRDS(hs, file = "/home/mstevens/Desktop/MAIN WORK/Presence Absence/Package Versions/silverblaze/inst/extdata/tutorial2_hitscore.rds")
```
