abstract = {Many of the first European settlers in Africa sought refuge from the heat and diseases of the plains by moving to the cool and salubrious highlands. Although many of the highlands were originally malaria free, there has been a progressive rise in the incidence of the disease over the last 50 years, largely as a consequence of agroforestry development, and it has been exacerbated by scarce health resources. In these areas of fringe transmission where the malaria patterns is unstable, epidemics may be precipitated by relatively subtle climatic changes. Since there is little immunity against the disease in these communities, outbreaks can be devastating, resulting in a substantial increase in morbidity and death among both children and adults. We present here the results obtained using a mathematical model designed to identify these epidemic-prone regions in the African highlands and the differences expected to occur as a result of projected global climate change. These highlands should be recognized as an area of special concern. We further recommend that a regional modelling approach should be adopted to assess the extent and severity of this problem and help improve disease surveillance and the quality of health care delivered in this unstable ecosystem.},

Restricting the analysis to thirty authors contemporary with the Sherlock Holmes stories, Conan Doyle ranks first, with a hit score of 2.8 percent (above Holmes's address at 221b Baker Street). Finally, we show that GP prioritizes sites strongly associated with Conan Doyle (example.g., his home) compared to those more tangentially associated with him, even when sites are close together. Our analysis, although mostly for amusement, underlines the ability of GP to extract useful information from complex data.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a "savvy" prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

abstract = {Not much is known about clinical decision-making in rural, low-resource settings regarding fever, a common reason for presentation to care. In this prospective cohort study of patients presenting with febrile illness to a rural Ugandan health center, we examined demographic and clinical factors predictive of an initial disposition of inpatient admission after clinical evaluation, but before laboratory testing. We then assessed the association of laboratory results and system factors with a change between initial and final disposition plans. Four thousand nine hundred twenty-four patients with suspected febrile illness were included in the primary analysis. The strongest predictors for an initial disposition of admission after clinical examination were impaired consciousness (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 3.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.44-4.21) and fever on examination (aRR, 2.27;95%CI: 1.79-2.87). Providers initially planned to discharge patients with significant vital sign abnormalities, including tachypnea (3.6%) and hypotension (1.3%). Anemia strongly predicted a final disposition of admission after an initial disposition of discharge (aRR, 48.34; 95% CI: 24.22-96.49); other laboratory abnormalities, including hypoglycemia and acidosis, did not change disposition planning. In those with an initial disposition of admission, living farther than the two neighboring villages was associated with a final disposition of discharge (aRR, 2.12; 95% CI: 1.10-4.12). A concerning number of patients with abnormal vital signs and laboratory results were not admitted for inpatient care. Geographic factors may influence a patient's final disposition contrary to a provider's initial disposition plan. Future work should assess longer term outcomes after discharge and a broader study population.},

abstract = {Due to their conceptual simplicity and flexibility, non-parametric mixture models are widely used to identify latent clusters in data. However, when it comes to Big Data, such as Landsat imagery, such model fitting is computationally prohibitive. To overcome this issue, we fit Bayesian non-parametric models to pre-smoothed data, thereby reducing the computational time from days to minutes, while disregarding little of the useful information. Tree based clustering is used to partition the clusters into smaller and smaller clusters in order to identify clusters of high, medium and low interest. The tree-based clustering method is applied to Landsat images from the Brisbane region, which were the actual sources of motivation for development of the method. The images are taken as a part of the red imported fire-ant eradication program that was launched in September 2001 and which is funded by all Australian states and territories, along with the federal government. To satisfy budgetary constraints, modelling is performed to estimate the risk of fire-ant incursion in each cluster so that the eradication program focuses on high risk clusters. The likelihood of containment is successfully derived by combining the fieldwork survey data with the results obtained from the proposed method.},

abstract = {1.Species distribution models are increasingly used to address questions in conservation biology, ecology and evolution. The most effective species distribution models require data on both species presence and the available environmental conditions (known as background or pseudo-absence data) in the area. However, there is still no consensus on how and where to sample these pseudo-absences and how many. 2.In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis based on simple simulated species distributions to propose guidelines on how, where and how many pseudo-absences should be generated to build reliable species distribution models. Depending on the quantity and quality of the initial presence data (unbiased vs. climatically or spatially biased), we assessed the relative effect of the method for selecting pseudo-absences (random vs. environmentally or spatially stratified) and their number on the predictive accuracy of seven common modelling techniques (regression, classification and machine-learning techniques). 3.When using regression techniques, the method used to select pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on the model's predictive accuracy. Randomly selected pseudo-absences yielded the most reliable distribution models. Models fitted with a large number of pseudo-absences but equally weighted to the presences (i.e. the weighted sum of presence equals the weighted sum of pseudo-absence) produced the most accurate predicted distributions. For classification and machine-learning techniques, the number of pseudo-absences had the greatest impact on model accuracy, and averaging several runs with fewer pseudo-absences than for regression techniques yielded the most predictive models. 4.Overall, we recommend the use of a large number (e.g. 10000) of pseudo-absences with equal weighting for presences and absences when using regression techniques (e.g. generalised linear model and generalised additive model); averaging several runs (e.g. 10) with fewer pseudo-absences (e.g. 100) with equal weighting for presences and absences with multiple adaptive regression splines and discriminant analyses; and using the same number of pseudo-absences as available presences (averaging several runs if few pseudo-absences) for classification techniques such as boosted regression trees, classification trees and random forest. In addition, we recommend the random selection of pseudo-absences when using regression techniques and the random selection of geographically and environmentally stratified pseudo-absences when using classification and machine-learning techniques. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {While Jeffreys priors usually are well-defined for the parameters of mixtures of distributions, they are not available in closed form. Furthermore, they often are improper priors. Hence, they have never been used to draw inference on the mixture parameters. The implementation and the properties of Jeffreys priors in several mixture settings are studied. It is shown that the associated posterior distributions most often are improper. Nevertheless, the Jeffreys prior for the mixture weights conditionally on the parameters of the mixture components will be shown to have the property of conservativeness with respect to the number of components, in case of overfitted mixture and it can be therefore used as a default priors in this context.},

abstract = {Reversible jump methods are the most commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo tool for exploring variable dimension statistical models. Recently, however, an alternative approach based on birth-and-death processes has been proposed by Stephens for mixtures of distributions. We show that the birth-and-death setting can be generalized to include other types of continuous time jumps like split-and-combine moves in the spirit of Richardson and Green. We illustrate these extensions both for mixtures of distributions and for hidden Markov models. We demonstrate the strong similarity of reversible jump and continuous time methodologies by showing that, on appropriate rescaling of time, the reversible jump chain converges to a limiting continuous time birth-and-death process. A numerical comparison in the setting of mixtures of distributions highlights this similarity.},

Four collections were made from Monterrey to examine local patterns of gene flow. Markers included 60 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) loci amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of variation in a 387-basepair region of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Seven mitochondrial haplotypes were detected and phylogenetic analysis identified two well-supported clades. Regression analysis of geographic distances and pairwise F(ST) estimated from RAPD markers indicated that populations are isolated by distance and that free gene flow occurs among collections within 90-250 km. Isolation by distance was not detected using mtDNA haplotypes. The Nuevo Laredo collection had unique RAPD and mtDNA haplotype frequencies and reduced heterozygosity suggesting that few mosquitoes established this population.},

abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

In this issue of Applied Cognitive Psychology, Rossmo challenges the validity of this research with respect to our data selection and methods of analysis. In response, we argue that: his proposed method for selecting data is unscientific; there is little evidence to support his claim that five crimes are required before profiles can be accurate; search area as a measure of profile accuracy has not yet been shown to be more useful than error distance; the heuristics we have examined are defined correctly and do lead to improvements in profile accuracy; and computerized geographic profiling is not a free service. Our comments aim to generate constraint in those intent on building confidence in computerized geographic profiling systems in the absence of strong empirical evidence to support their use.

A single experiment tested the ability of participants (N=215) and an actuarial technique to accurately predict the residential locations of serial offenders based on information about where their crimes were committed. Results indicated that participants introduced to a 'Circle' or 'Decay' heuristic showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of predictions, and that their post-training performance did not differ significantly from the predictions of one leading actuarial technique. Further analysis of individual performances indicated that approximately 50% of participants used appropriate heuristics that typically led to accurate predictions even before they received training, while nearly 75% improved their predictive accuracy once introduced to either of the two heuristics. Several possible explanations for participants' accurate performances are discussed and the practical implications for police investigations are highlighted.

abstract = {The ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri is one of the best-known invasive species in the UK. It is also arguably the species whose origins as an invasive have been the subject of the greatest speculation, with explanations ranging from birds escaping from the set of the film ‘The African Queen' to animals being released in Carnaby Street in London by Jimi Hendrix in the 1960s. Here, we use geographic profiling – a statistical technique originally developed in criminology to prioritise the large lists of suspects typical in cases of serial crime such as murder, rape and arson, but more recently applied to ecology and conservation biology – to analyse the spatial patterns of the ring-necked parakeet, from the first detailed records in the 1960s to the 21st century and ask whether spatial analysis supports these hypotheses. We show that, despite the undoubted appeal of the different hypotheses concerning their origin, spatial analysis provides no support for any of them, leading us to conclude that the birds' establishment in Britain is more likely to be a consequence of repeated releases and introductions, a view supported by a detailed search of the British Newspaper Archive. More generally, our study shows how geographic profiling can be used to understand the spatial patterns of biological invasions over time.},

abstract = {Assessment of abundance, survival, recruitment rates, and density (i.e., population assessment) is especially challenging for elusive species most in need of protection (e.g., rare carnivores). Individual identification methods, such as DNA sampling, provide ways of studying such species efficiently and noninvasively. Additionally, statistical methods that correct for undetected animals and account for locations where animals are captured are available to efficiently estimate density and other demographic parameters. We collected hair samples of European wildcat (Felis silvestris) from cheek-rub lure sticks, extracted DNA from the samples, and identified each animals' genotype. To estimate the density of wildcats, we used Bayesian inference in a spatial capture-recapture model. We used WinBUGS to fit a model that accounted for differences in detection probability among individuals and seasons and between two lure arrays. We detected 21 individual wildcats (including possible hybrids) 47 times. Wildcat density was estimated at 0.29/km2 (SE 0.06), and 95% of the activity of wildcats was estimated to occur within 1.83 km from their home-range center. Lures located systematically were associated with a greater number of detections than lures placed in a cell on the basis of expert opinion. Detection probability of individual cats was greatest in late March. Our model is a generalized linear mixed model; hence, it can be easily extended, for instance, to incorporate trap- and individual-level covariates. We believe that the combined use of noninvasive sampling techniques and spatial capture-recapture models will improve population assessments, especially for rare and elusive animals. {\textcopyright}2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Classical closed-population capture-recapture models do not accommodate the spatial information inherent in encounter history data obtained from camera-trapping studies. As a result, individual heterogeneity in encounter probability is induced, and it is not possible to estimate density objectively because trap arrays do not have a well-defined sample area. We applied newly-developed, capture-recapture models that accommodate the spatial attribute inherent in capture-recapture data to a population of wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Southeast Alaska in 2008. We used camera-trapping data collected from 37 cameras in a 2,140-km2 area of forested and open habitats largely enclosed by ocean and glacial icefields. We detected 21 unique individuals 115 times. Wolverines exhibited a strong positive trap response, with an increased tendency to revisit previously visited traps. Under the trap-response model, we estimated wolverine density at 9.7 individuals/1,000km2 (95% Bayesian CI: 5.9-15.0). Our model provides a formal statistical framework for estimating density from wolverine camera-trapping studies that accounts for a behavioral response due to baited traps. Further, our model-based estimator does not have strict requirements about the spatial configuration of traps or length of trapping sessions, providing considerable operational flexibility in the development of field studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {Most capture-recapture studies are inherently spatial in nature, with capture probabilities depending on the location of traps relative to animals. The spatial component of the studies has until recently, however, not been incorporated in statistical capture-recapture models. This paper reviews capture-recapture models that do include an explicit spatial component. This is done in a non-technical way, omitting much of the algebraic detail and focussing on the model formulation rather than on the estimation methods (which include inverse prediction, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods). One can view spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models as an endpoint of a series of spatial sampling models, starting with circular plot survey models and moving through conventional distance sampling models, with and without measurement errors, through mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models. This paper attempts a synthesis of these models in what I hope is a style accessible to non-specialists, placing SECR models in the context of other spatial sampling models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dt.

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the environment induces variation in population demographic rates and dispersal patterns, which result in spatio-temporal variation in density and gene flow. Unfortunately, applying theory to learn about the role of spatial structure on populations has been hindered by the lack of mechanistic spatial models and inability to make precise observations of population state and structure. Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) represents an individual-based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory. SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and they have been widely adopted in the last decade. We review the historical context and emerging developments in SCR models that enable the integration of explicit ecological hypotheses about landscape connectivity, movement, resource selection, and spatial variation in density, directly with individual encounter history data obtained by new technologies (e.g. camera trapping, non-invasive DNA sampling). We describe ways in which SCR methods stand to advance the study of animal population ecology.},

abstract = {Unbiased estimation of population density is a major and unsolved problem in animal trapping studies. This paper describes a new and general method for estimating density from closed-population capture-recapture data. Many estimators exist for the size (N) and mean capture probability (p) of a closed population. These statistics suffer from an unknown bias due to edge effect that varies with trap layout_and home range size. The mean distance between successive captures of an individual (d) provides information on the scale of individual movements, but is itself a function of trap spacing and grid size. Our aim is to define and estimate parameters that do not depend on the trap layout. In the new method, simulation and inverse prediction are used to estimate jointly the population density (D) and two parameters of individual capture probability, magnitude (g0) and spatial scale ($\sigma$), from the information in N̂, p̄ and d̄. The method uses any configuration of traps (e.g. grid, web or line) and any choice of closed-population estimator. It is assumed that home ranges have a stationary distribution in two dimensions, and that capture events may be simulated as the outcome of competing Poisson processes in time. The method is applied to simulated and field data. The estimator appears unusually robust and free from bias.},

abstract = {Live-trapping capture-recapture studies of animal populations with fixed trap locations inevitably have a spatial component: animals close to traps are more likely to be caught than those far away. This is not addressed in conventional closed-population estimates of abundance and without the spatial component, rigorous estimates of density cannot be obtained. We propose new, flexible capture-recapture models that use the capture locations to estimate animal locations and spatially referenced capture probability. The models are likelihood-based and hence allow use of Akaike's information criterion or other likelihood-based methods of model selection. Density is an explicit parameter, and the evaluation of its dependence on spatial or temporal covariates is therefore straightforward. Additional (nonspatial) variation in capture probability may be modeled as in conventional capture-recapture. The method is tested by simulation, using a model in which capture probability depends only on location relative to traps. Point estimators are found to be unbiased and standard error estimators almost unbiased. The method is used to estimate the density of Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) from mist-netting data from the Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland, U.S.A. Estimates agree well with those from an existing spatially explicit method based on inverse prediction. A variety of additional spatially explicit models are fitted; these include models with temporal stratification, behavioral response, and heterogeneous animal home ranges. {\textcopyright} 2008, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Natal dispersal is of central interest when determining demography and genetic structure of populations and managing endangered, species with fragmented distributions. However, methodological limitations linked to spatial and temporal constraints have prevented studies of natal dispersal in long-lived birds. Moreover, the consequences of natal dispersal have mainly been related to the first breeding attempt rather than to lifetime reproductive success. We studied the causes and fitness consequences of natal dispersal in a population of Black Kites at Do{\~{n}}ana National Park (southern Spain). From 1986 to 1995 we marked 2929 nestlings with plastic numbered bands. We annually monitored marked birds in breeding territories, their breeding success, and the survival of nonbreeding birds. Additionally, we searched for marked birds in broad areas of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Median natal dispersal distance was 4.8 km (N = 285), with males more of ten dispersing shorter distances and females dispersing at all distance categories equally. Density of conspecifics negatively affected dispersal distances of both males and females. In addition, single and first-hatched males born in areas with high breeding density dispersed shorter distances. Dispersal distances tended to be correlated between siblings, possibly a result of sharing similar environmental conditions. We did not find evidence that dispersal was an active mechanism aimed to prevent close inbreeding. Patterns of dispersal in this population are probably driven by intraspecific competition. Males that dispersed shorter distances showed higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS). LRS did not differ among females dispersing different distances, but females that dispersed farther mated with more experienced males. These sex differences in dispersal patterns and their consequences may be explained by the inequality between sexes in breeding roles in this species. Familiarity with the natal area could be important for males, which defend territories and resources, while females may increase their fitness through mate choice and breeding dispersal. High levels of philopatry in Do{\~{n}}ana National Park may be a result of a surplus of food resources and the effects of conspecific attraction in densely populated areas. However, the degree of philopatry may vary between populations and with time, subject to differences in ecological pressures.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct an independent analysis of all existing geographic profiling software packages to determine if anyone is more accurate than the others or if any of the software systems are any more accurate than simple spatial distribution strategies at locating the home base of serial offenders. Design/methodology/approach - An analysis was conducted of all existing geographic profiling software as well as three spatial distribution methods of profiling. Differences in accuracy were assessed using four different methods: dichotomous profile accuracy, simple error measurement, profile error distance, and average top profile area. Findings - Results indicate that not only are the different profiling software systems no more accurate than the spatial distribution control methods, but that accuracy in general was marginal at best. In addition results indicated that certain crimes, such as commercial robbery, were particularly difficult to profile and that the number of crimes in a series was not by itself a good indicator of success of a profile. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows that future research needs to focus more on determining how various factors such as city type, crime type, road network and spatial aspects of a crime series (dispersion and search area) impact profiling accuracy. In addition future research should also endeavor to determine whether these advanced strategies are substantially more accurate than other simple profiling strategies such as human prediction. Finally, future research should also seek to examine geographic profiling in a real world setting and how geographic profiling impacts the succes of open investigations Practical implications- Practically, this study casts doubt not only on the overall accuracy of profiling strategies in predicting the likely home location of an offender, but also on whether probability strategies are substantially better than spatial distribution strategies. Originality/value - This research was the first to independently analyze all of the existing geographic profiling systems against control methods for the purpose of determining the accuracy of these different methods.},

abstract = {Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus Skuse mosquitoes transmit serious human arboviral diseases including yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Females of the two species have adapted to undergo preimaginal development in natural or artificial collections of freshwater near human habitations and feed on human blood. While there is an effective vaccine against yellow fever, the control of dengue and chikungunya is mainly dependent on reducing freshwater preimaginal development habitats of the two vectors. We show here that Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus lay eggs and their larvae survive to emerge as adults in brackish water (water with <0.5 ppt or parts per thousand, 0.5-30 ppt and >30 ppt salt are termed fresh, brackish and saline respectively). Brackish water with salinity of 2 to 15 ppt in discarded plastic and glass containers, abandoned fishing boats and unused wells in coastal peri-urban environment were found to contain Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae. Relatively high incidence of dengue in Jaffna city, Sri Lanka was observed in the vicinity of brackish water habitats containing Ae. aegypti larvae. These observations raise the possibility that brackish water-adapted Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus may play a hitherto unrecognized role in transmitting dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever in coastal urban areas. National and international health authorities therefore need to take the findings into consideration and extend their vector control efforts, which are presently focused on urban freshwater habitats, to include brackish water larval development habitats. {\textcopyright} 2011 Ramasamy et al.},

However, the evidence for physical and non-physical health benefits of urban green space is unclear. Methods A literature search of academic and grey literature was conducted for studies and reviews of the health effects of green space. Articles found were appraised for their relevance, critically reviewed and graded accordingly. Their findings were then thematically categorized. Results There is weak evidence for the links between physical, mental health and well-being, and urban green space. Environmental factors such as the quality and accessibility of green space affects its use for physical activity. User determinants, such as age, gender, ethnicity and the perception of safety, are also important. However, many studies were limited by poor study design, failure to exclude confounding, bias or reverse causality and weak statistical associations. ConclusionMost studies reported findings that generally supported the view that green space have a beneficial health effect. Establishing a causal relationship is difficult, as the relationship is complex. Simplistic urban interventions may therefore fail to address the underlying determinants of urban health that are not remediable by landscape redesign. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity rates in the USA show distinct geographical patterns. The present study used spatial cluster detection methods and individual-level data to locate obesity clusters and to analyse them in relation to the neighbourhood built environment.\n\nMETHODS: The 2008-2009 Seattle Obesity Study provided data on the self-reported height, weight, and sociodemographic characteristics of 1602 King County adults. Home addresses were geocoded. Clusters of high or low body mass index were identified using Anselin's Local Moran's I and a spatial scan statistic with regression models that searched for unmeasured neighbourhood-level factors from residuals, adjusting for measured individual-level covariates. Spatially continuous values of objectively measured features of the local neighbourhood built environment (SmartMaps) were constructed for seven variables obtained from tax rolls and commercial databases.\n\nRESULTS: Both the Local Moran's I and a spatial scan statistic identified similar spatial concentrations of obesity. High and low obesity clusters were attenuated after adjusting for age, gender, race, education and income, and they disappeared once neighbourhood residential property values and residential density were included in the model.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Using individual-level data to detect obesity clusters with two cluster detection methods, the present study showed that the spatial concentration of obesity was wholly explained by neighbourhood composition and socioeconomic characteristics. These characteristics may serve to more precisely locate obesity prevention and intervention programmes.},

abstract = {Greenspace is theoretically a valuable resource for physical activity and hence has potential to contribute to reducing obesity and improving health. This paper reports on a systematic review of quantitative research examining the association between objectively measured access to greenspace and (i) Physical activity, (ii) Weight status and (iii) Health conditions related to elevated weight. Literature searches were conducted in SCOPUS, Medline, Embase and PYSCHINFO. Sixty studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed for methodological quality and strength of the evidence. The majority (68%) of papers found a positive or weak association between greenspace and obesity-related health indicators, but findings were inconsistent and mixed across studies. Several studies found the relationship varied by factors such as age, socioeconomic status and greenspace measure. Developing a theoretical framework which considers the correlates and interactions between different types of greenspace and health would help study design and interpretation of reported findings, as would improvement in quality and consistency of greenspace access measures. Key areas for future research include investigating if and how people actually use greenspace and improving understanding of the mechanisms through which greenspace can improve health and, in particular, if physical activity is one such mechanism.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

abstract = {Freshwater mussels play important roles in ecosystems and are globally
imperiled. Adult mussels are sedentary and dispersal is as larvae
attached to fish hosts and as juveniles in stream drift. Understanding
juvenile dispersal is important for understanding the patchy
distribution of adult mussels and for conservation. We propose the
location in which a juvenile mussel ends up on the streambed is
determined by a combination of the juvenile's settling velocity, current
speed, and streambed topography. We conducted a laboratory experiment to
quantify the settling velocities of juveniles of four mussel species and
of polymer microparticles, later utilized as surrogates for juveniles.
We performed a flume experiment where we measured drift distances of
microparticles at three low flow velocities over gravel and over a
simulated mussel bed (gravel combined with mussel shells). Lastly, we
measured drift distances of microparticles at five sites in two small
rivers under summer low flow conditions. There were no significant
differences in settling velocities among the four mussel species, live
juveniles sank at a significantly lower rate than dead juveniles, and
there were no significant differences in settling velocities between
live juveniles and microparticles. The distances microparticles drifted
in the flume increased with flow velocity and were shorter over the
simulated mussel bed than over gravel. In the field most microparticles
were recaptured near their release locations. In this study, juvenile
mussels had limited dispersal potential with most drifting < 10 in. This
limited dispersal should result in many juveniles settling within mussel
beds, areas where habitat conditions are favorable for survival and
growth, and may contribute to the patchy spatial distribution of mussel
beds in rivers.},

abstract = {In plant ecology, characterising colonisation and extinction in plant metapopulations is challenging due to the non-detectable seed bank that allows plants to emerge after several years of absence. In this study, we used a Hidden Markov Model to characterise seed dormancy, colonisation and germination solely from the presence-absence of standing flora. Applying the model to data from a long-term survey of 38 annual weeds across France, we identified three homogeneous functional groups: (1) species persisting preferentially through spatial colonisation, (2) species persisting preferentially through seed dormancy and (3) a mix of both strategies. These groups are consistent with existing ecological knowledge, demonstrating that ecologically meaningful parameters can be estimated from simple presence-absence observations. These results indicate that such studies could contribute to the design of weed management strategies. They also open the possibility of testing life-history theories such as the dormancy/colonisation trade-off in natura.},

abstract = {An important issue within health services research is the correct allocation of resources within health authority regions and the capability of public health professionals to make such allocation appropriately. This allocation is often based on a mapping of relevant disease incidence and the assessment of the geographical distribution of relative risk of disease in small areas within the health authority administrative domain. Existing methods for the statistical analysis of small area risk are mostly based on smoothing methods. However, these methods often smooth over large discontinuities in the risk surface which might be important to maintain for the purposes of resource allocation. In this paper we propose a method that involves the use of spatial mixtures of components that can provide a balance between smoothness and the maintenance of discontinuity. The method is applied to a sudden infant death incidence data set. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As global progress to reduce malaria transmission continues, it is increasingly important to track changes in malaria incidence rather than prevalence. Risk estimates for Africa have largely underutilized available health management information systems (HMIS) data to monitor trends. This study uses national HMIS data, together with environmental and geographical data, to assess spatial-temporal patterns of malaria incidence at facility catchment level in Uganda, over a recent 5-year period. METHODS: Data reported by 3446 health facilities in Uganda, between July 2015 and September 2019, was analysed. To assess the geographic accessibility of the health facilities network, AccessMod was employed to determine a three-hour cost-distance catchment around each facility. Using confirmed malaria cases and total catchment population by facility, an ecological Bayesian conditional autoregressive spatial-temporal Poisson model was fitted to generate monthly posterior incidence rate estimates, adjusted for caregiver education, rainfall, land surface temperature, night-time light (an indicator of urbanicity), and vegetation index. RESULTS: An estimated 38.8 million (95% Credible Interval [CI]: 37.9-40.9) confirmed cases of malaria occurred over the period, with a national mean monthly incidence rate of 20.4 (95% CI: 19.9-21.5) cases per 1000, ranging from 8.9 (95% CI: 8.7-9.4) to 36.6 (95% CI: 35.7-38.5) across the study period. Strong seasonality was observed, with June-July experiencing highest peaks and February-March the lowest peaks. There was also considerable geographic heterogeneity in incidence, with health facility catchment relative risk during peak transmission months ranging from 0 to 50.5 (95% CI: 49.0-50.8) times higher than national average. Both districts and health facility catchments showed significant positive spatial autocorrelation; health facility catchments had global Moran's I = 0.3 (p < 0.001) and districts Moran's I = 0.4 (p < 0.001). Notably, significant clusters of high-risk health facility catchments were concentrated in Acholi, West Nile, Karamoja, and East Central - Busoga regions. CONCLUSION: Findings showed clear countrywide spatial-temporal patterns with clustering of malaria risk across districts and health facility catchments within high risk regions, which can facilitate targeting of interventions to those areas at highest risk. Moreover, despite high and perennial transmission, seasonality for malaria incidence highlights the potential for optimal and timely implementation of targeted interventions.},

abstract = {Background: Reported tuberculosis (TB) incidence globally continues to be heavily influenced by expert opinion of case detection rates and ecological estimates of disease duration. Both approaches are recognised as having substantial variability and inaccuracy, leading to uncertainty in true TB incidence and other such derived statistics. Methods: We developed Bayesian binomial mixture geospatial models to estimate TB incidence and case detection rate (CDR) in Ethiopia. In these models the underlying true incidence was formulated as a partially observed Markovian process following a mixed Poisson distribution and the detected (observed) TB cases as a binomial distribution, conditional on CDR and true incidence. The models use notification data from multiple areas over several years and account for the existence of undetected TB cases and variability in true underlying incidence and CDR. Deviance information criteria (DIC) were used to select the best performing model. Results: A geospatial model was the best fitting approach. This model estimated that TB incidence in Sheka Zone increased from 198 (95% Credible Interval (CrI) 187, 233) per 100,000 population in 2010 to 232 (95% CrI 212, 253) per 100,000 population in 2014. The model revealed a wide discrepancy between the estimated incidence rate and notification rate, with the estimated incidence ranging from 1.4 (in 2014) to 1.7 (in 2010) times the notification rate (CDR of 71% and 60% respectively). Population density and TB incidence in neighbouring locations (spatial lag) predicted the underlying TB incidence, while health facility availability predicted higher CDR. Conclusion: Our model estimated trends in underlying TB incidence while accounting for undetected cases and revealed significant discrepancies between incidence and notification rates in rural Ethiopia. This approach provides an alternative approach to estimating incidence, entirely independent of the methods involved in current estimates and is feasible to perform from routinely collected surveillance data.},

abstract = {Introduction: Malaria is re-emerging in most of the African highlands exposing the non immune population to deadly epidemics. A better understanding of the factors impacting transmission in the highlands is crucial to improve well targeted malaria control strategies. Methods and Findings: A conceptual model of potential malaria risk factors in the highlands was built based on the available literature. Furthermore, the relative importance of these factors on malaria can be estimated through "classification and regression trees", an unexploited statistical method in the malaria field. This CART method was used to analyse the malaria risk factors in the Burundi highlands. The results showed that Anopheles density was the best predictor for high malaria prevalence. Then lower rainfall, no vector control, higher minimum temperature and houses near breeding sites were associated by order of importance to higher Anopheles density. Conclusions: In Burundi highlands monitoring Anopheles densities when rainfall is low may be able to predict epidemics. The conceptual model combined with the CART analysis is a decision support tool that could provide an important contribution toward the prevention and control of malaria by identifying major risk factors. {\textcopyright} 2009 Protopopoff et al.},

Here, we describe a novel use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) collected at a single facility as source material for sequencing to esimtate malaria transmission intensity across a relatively large catchment area. We extracted Plasmodium falciparum DNA from RDTs, then amplified and sequenced a region of the apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) using targeted amplicon deep sequencing. We determined the multiplicity of infection (MOI) for each sample and examined associations with demographic, clinical, and spatial factors. We successfully genotyped 223 of 287 (77.7%) of the samples. We demonstrated an inverse relationship between the MOI and elevation with individuals presenting from the highest elevation villages harboring infections approximately half as complex as those from the lowest (MOI 1.85 vs. 3.51, AOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.65, p = 0.004). This study demonstrates the feasibility and validity of using routinely-collected RDTs for molecular surveillance of malaria and has real-world utility, especially as the cost of high-throughpout sequencing continues to decline.},

abstract = {Many of malaria's signs and symptoms are indistinguishable from those of other febrile diseases. Detection of the presence of Plasmodium parasites is essential, therefore, to guide case management. Improved diagnostic tools are required to enable targeted treatment of infected individuals. In addition, field-ready diagnostic tools for mass screening and surveillance that can detect asymptomatic infections of very low parasite densities are needed to monitor transmission reduction and ensure elimination. Antibody-based tests for infection and novel methods based on biomarkers need further development and validation, as do methods for the detection and treatment of Plasmodium vivax. Current rapid diagnostic tests targeting P. vivax are generally less effective than those targeting Plasmodium falciparum. Moreover, because current drugs for radical cure may cause serious side effects in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, more information is needed on the distribution of G6PD-deficiency variants as well as tests to identify at-risk individuals. Finally, in an environment of very low or absent malaria transmission, sustaining interest in elimination and maintaining resources will become increasingly important. Thus, research is required into the context in which malaria diagnostic tests are used, into diagnostics for other febrile diseases, and into the integration of these tests into health systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 The malERA Consultative Group.},

abstract = {Malaria remains one of the leading health problems of the developing world, and Uganda bears a particularly large burden from the disease. Our understanding is limited by a lack of reliable data, but it is clear that the prevalence of malaria infection, incidence of disease, and mortality from severe malaria all remain very high. Uganda has made progress in implementing key malaria control measures, in particular distribution of insecticide-impregnated bednets, indoor residual spraying of insecticides, utilization of artemisinin-based combination therapy to treat uncomplicated malaria, and provision of intermittent preventive therapy for pregnant women. However, despite enthusiasm regarding the potential for the elimination of malaria in other areas, there is no convincing evidence that the burden of malaria has decreased in Uganda in recent years. Major challenges to malaria control in Uganda include very high malaria transmission intensity, inadequate health care resources, a weak health system, inadequate understanding of malaria epidemiology and the impact of control interventions, increasing resistance of parasites to drugs and of mosquitoes to insecticides, inappropriate case management, inadequate utilization of drugs to prevent malaria, and inadequate epidemic preparedness and response. Despite these challenges, prospects for the control of malaria have improved, and with attention to underlying challenges, progress toward the control of malaria in Uganda can be expected. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the baseline malaria transmission in a given environment is important to guide malaria control interventions. However, in Uganda, recent information on malaria transmission intensity is lacking. Therefore, a 1-year entomological study was conducted in seven ecologically different sites throughout the country to assess spatial and temporal patterns in malaria transmission intensity. Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto was the main vector in five of the seven study sites, and An. funestus was the most important vector in the two other sites. In a peri-urban village, An. arabiensis contributed substantially to malaria transmission. Clear differences in annual entomological inoculation rates (AEIR) were observed between the study sites, ranging from 4 infective bites per person per year in the southwestern part of the country to >1,500 infective bites per person per year in a swampy area near the Nile River. Between villages with parasite prevalences of ≥80% in children between 1 and 9 years old, a 4-fold difference in AEIR was observed. Based on the observed behavior of the vectors, insecticide-treated bed nets will be highly effective in controlling malaria. However, in the high transmission areas, additional measures will be needed to reduce the malaria burden to acceptable levels.

They are of flexible form, thus can be used where simple parametric models are found to be inappropriate or difficult to specify. Two examples are given to illustrate the fixed and adaptive kernel approaches in data analysis and to compare the methods. Various choices for the smoothing parameter used in kernel methods are discussed. Since kernel methods give alternative approaches to the Anderson (1982) Fourier transform method, some comparisons are made.},

@article{Lawson2006,
abstract = {This paper reviews issues in the analysis of non-focussed clustering, and proposes a novel approach to cluster modelling that can be used in a surveillance context. The novel approach involves the use of local likelihood models for the analysis of clustering in small area health data. Local likelihood is used when interdependence between data events at locations is modelled directly, as opposed to the modelling of a hidden process of cluster centres. This approach allows the use of conventional posterior sampling. It also allows a less parameterized approach to the form of clusters detected. The idea of a spatially dependent lasso which provides the local maxima for the aggregation of locations is considered as an approximation. The methods are applied to a well known data set and compared with Satscan, and a conditional logistic Bayesian model. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the use of the Gibbs Sampler and other Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in two applications in environmental epidemiology. The first example concerns the application of a Metropolis—Hastings/Gibbs sampler to a Cox process with a direction‐dependent cluster variance parameter. The second example consists of the estimation of the posterior (spatial) distribution of a putative location. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
