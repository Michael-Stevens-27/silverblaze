abstract = {Reversible jump methods are the most commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo tool for exploring variable dimension statistical models. Recently, however, an alternative approach based on birth-and-death processes has been proposed by Stephens for mixtures of distributions. We show that the birth-and-death setting can be generalized to include other types of continuous time jumps like split-and-combine moves in the spirit of Richardson and Green. We illustrate these extensions both for mixtures of distributions and for hidden Markov models. We demonstrate the strong similarity of reversible jump and continuous time methodologies by showing that, on appropriate rescaling of time, the reversible jump chain converges to a limiting continuous time birth-and-death process. A numerical comparison in the setting of mixtures of distributions highlights this similarity.},

Four collections were made from Monterrey to examine local patterns of gene flow. Markers included 60 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) loci amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of variation in a 387-basepair region of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Seven mitochondrial haplotypes were detected and phylogenetic analysis identified two well-supported clades. Regression analysis of geographic distances and pairwise F(ST) estimated from RAPD markers indicated that populations are isolated by distance and that free gene flow occurs among collections within 90-250 km. Isolation by distance was not detected using mtDNA haplotypes. The Nuevo Laredo collection had unique RAPD and mtDNA haplotype frequencies and reduced heterozygosity suggesting that few mosquitoes established this population.},

abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

In this issue of Applied Cognitive Psychology, Rossmo challenges the validity of this research with respect to our data selection and methods of analysis. In response, we argue that: his proposed method for selecting data is unscientific; there is little evidence to support his claim that five crimes are required before profiles can be accurate; search area as a measure of profile accuracy has not yet been shown to be more useful than error distance; the heuristics we have examined are defined correctly and do lead to improvements in profile accuracy; and computerized geographic profiling is not a free service. Our comments aim to generate constraint in those intent on building confidence in computerized geographic profiling systems in the absence of strong empirical evidence to support their use.

A single experiment tested the ability of participants (N=215) and an actuarial technique to accurately predict the residential locations of serial offenders based on information about where their crimes were committed. Results indicated that participants introduced to a 'Circle' or 'Decay' heuristic showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of predictions, and that their post-training performance did not differ significantly from the predictions of one leading actuarial technique. Further analysis of individual performances indicated that approximately 50% of participants used appropriate heuristics that typically led to accurate predictions even before they received training, while nearly 75% improved their predictive accuracy once introduced to either of the two heuristics. Several possible explanations for participants' accurate performances are discussed and the practical implications for police investigations are highlighted.

abstract = {The ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri is one of the best-known invasive species in the UK. It is also arguably the species whose origins as an invasive have been the subject of the greatest speculation, with explanations ranging from birds escaping from the set of the film ‘The African Queen' to animals being released in Carnaby Street in London by Jimi Hendrix in the 1960s. Here, we use geographic profiling – a statistical technique originally developed in criminology to prioritise the large lists of suspects typical in cases of serial crime such as murder, rape and arson, but more recently applied to ecology and conservation biology – to analyse the spatial patterns of the ring-necked parakeet, from the first detailed records in the 1960s to the 21st century and ask whether spatial analysis supports these hypotheses. We show that, despite the undoubted appeal of the different hypotheses concerning their origin, spatial analysis provides no support for any of them, leading us to conclude that the birds' establishment in Britain is more likely to be a consequence of repeated releases and introductions, a view supported by a detailed search of the British Newspaper Archive. More generally, our study shows how geographic profiling can be used to understand the spatial patterns of biological invasions over time.},

abstract = {Assessment of abundance, survival, recruitment rates, and density (i.e., population assessment) is especially challenging for elusive species most in need of protection (e.g., rare carnivores). Individual identification methods, such as DNA sampling, provide ways of studying such species efficiently and noninvasively. Additionally, statistical methods that correct for undetected animals and account for locations where animals are captured are available to efficiently estimate density and other demographic parameters. We collected hair samples of European wildcat (Felis silvestris) from cheek-rub lure sticks, extracted DNA from the samples, and identified each animals' genotype. To estimate the density of wildcats, we used Bayesian inference in a spatial capture-recapture model. We used WinBUGS to fit a model that accounted for differences in detection probability among individuals and seasons and between two lure arrays. We detected 21 individual wildcats (including possible hybrids) 47 times. Wildcat density was estimated at 0.29/km2 (SE 0.06), and 95% of the activity of wildcats was estimated to occur within 1.83 km from their home-range center. Lures located systematically were associated with a greater number of detections than lures placed in a cell on the basis of expert opinion. Detection probability of individual cats was greatest in late March. Our model is a generalized linear mixed model; hence, it can be easily extended, for instance, to incorporate trap- and individual-level covariates. We believe that the combined use of noninvasive sampling techniques and spatial capture-recapture models will improve population assessments, especially for rare and elusive animals. {\textcopyright}2010 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Classical closed-population capture-recapture models do not accommodate the spatial information inherent in encounter history data obtained from camera-trapping studies. As a result, individual heterogeneity in encounter probability is induced, and it is not possible to estimate density objectively because trap arrays do not have a well-defined sample area. We applied newly-developed, capture-recapture models that accommodate the spatial attribute inherent in capture-recapture data to a population of wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Southeast Alaska in 2008. We used camera-trapping data collected from 37 cameras in a 2,140-km2 area of forested and open habitats largely enclosed by ocean and glacial icefields. We detected 21 unique individuals 115 times. Wolverines exhibited a strong positive trap response, with an increased tendency to revisit previously visited traps. Under the trap-response model, we estimated wolverine density at 9.7 individuals/1,000km2 (95% Bayesian CI: 5.9-15.0). Our model provides a formal statistical framework for estimating density from wolverine camera-trapping studies that accounts for a behavioral response due to baited traps. Further, our model-based estimator does not have strict requirements about the spatial configuration of traps or length of trapping sessions, providing considerable operational flexibility in the development of field studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract = {Most capture-recapture studies are inherently spatial in nature, with capture probabilities depending on the location of traps relative to animals. The spatial component of the studies has until recently, however, not been incorporated in statistical capture-recapture models. This paper reviews capture-recapture models that do include an explicit spatial component. This is done in a non-technical way, omitting much of the algebraic detail and focussing on the model formulation rather than on the estimation methods (which include inverse prediction, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods). One can view spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models as an endpoint of a series of spatial sampling models, starting with circular plot survey models and moving through conventional distance sampling models, with and without measurement errors, through mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models. This paper attempts a synthesis of these models in what I hope is a style accessible to non-specialists, placing SECR models in the context of other spatial sampling models. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dt.

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity in the environment induces variation in population demographic rates and dispersal patterns, which result in spatio-temporal variation in density and gene flow. Unfortunately, applying theory to learn about the role of spatial structure on populations has been hindered by the lack of mechanistic spatial models and inability to make precise observations of population state and structure. Spatial capture–recapture (SCR) represents an individual-based analytic framework for overcoming this fundamental obstacle that has limited the utility of ecological theory. SCR methods make explicit use of spatial encounter information on individuals in order to model density and other spatial aspects of animal population structure, and they have been widely adopted in the last decade. We review the historical context and emerging developments in SCR models that enable the integration of explicit ecological hypotheses about landscape connectivity, movement, resource selection, and spatial variation in density, directly with individual encounter history data obtained by new technologies (e.g. camera trapping, non-invasive DNA sampling). We describe ways in which SCR methods stand to advance the study of animal population ecology.},

@article{Efford2004,
abstract = {Unbiased estimation of population density is a major and unsolved problem in animal trapping studies. This paper describes a new and general method for estimating density from closed-population capture-recapture data. Many estimators exist for the size (N) and mean capture probability (p) of a closed population. These statistics suffer from an unknown bias due to edge effect that varies with trap layout_and home range size. The mean distance between successive captures of an individual (d) provides information on the scale of individual movements, but is itself a function of trap spacing and grid size. Our aim is to define and estimate parameters that do not depend on the trap layout. In the new method, simulation and inverse prediction are used to estimate jointly the population density (D) and two parameters of individual capture probability, magnitude (g0) and spatial scale ($\sigma$), from the information in N̂, p̄ and d̄. The method uses any configuration of traps (e.g. grid, web or line) and any choice of closed-population estimator. It is assumed that home ranges have a stationary distribution in two dimensions, and that capture events may be simulated as the outcome of competing Poisson processes in time. The method is applied to simulated and field data. The estimator appears unusually robust and free from bias.},

@article{Chandler2013,
abstract = {Recently developed spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models represent a major advance over traditional capture-recapture (CR) models because they yield explicit estimates of animal density instead of population size within an unknown area. Furthermore, unlike nonspatial CR methods, SCR models account for heterogeneity in capture probability arising from the juxtaposition of animal activity centers and sample locations. Although the utility of SCR methods is gaining recognition, the requirement that all individuals can be uniquely identified excludes their use in many contexts. In this paper, we develop models for situations in which individual recognition is not possible, thereby allowing SCR concepts to be applied in studies of unmarked or partially marked populations. The data required for our model are spatially referenced counts made on one or more sample occasions at a collection of closely spaced sample units such that individuals can be encountered at multiple locations. Our approach includes a spatial point process for the animal activity centers and uses the spatial correlation in counts as information about the number and location of the activity centers. Camera-traps, hair snares, track plates, sound recordings, and even point counts can yield spatially correlated count data, and thus our model is widely applicable. A simulation study demonstrated that while the posterior mean exhibits frequentist bias on the order of 5-10% in small samples, the posterior mode is an accurate point estimator as long as adequate spatial correlation is present. Marking a subset of the population substantially increases posterior precision and is recommended whenever possible. We applied our model to avian point count data collected on an unmarked population of the northern parula (Parula americana) and obtained a density estimate (posterior mode) of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.19-1.64) birds/ha. Our paper challenges sampling and analytical conventions in ecology by demonstrating that neither spatial independence nor individual recognition is needed to estimate population density-rather, spatial dependence can be informative about individual distribution and density. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013.},

@article{Borchers2008,
abstract = {Live-trapping capture-recapture studies of animal populations with fixed trap locations inevitably have a spatial component: animals close to traps are more likely to be caught than those far away. This is not addressed in conventional closed-population estimates of abundance and without the spatial component, rigorous estimates of density cannot be obtained. We propose new, flexible capture-recapture models that use the capture locations to estimate animal locations and spatially referenced capture probability. The models are likelihood-based and hence allow use of Akaike's information criterion or other likelihood-based methods of model selection. Density is an explicit parameter, and the evaluation of its dependence on spatial or temporal covariates is therefore straightforward. Additional (nonspatial) variation in capture probability may be modeled as in conventional capture-recapture. The method is tested by simulation, using a model in which capture probability depends only on location relative to traps. Point estimators are found to be unbiased and standard error estimators almost unbiased. The method is used to estimate the density of Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) from mist-netting data from the Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland, U.S.A. Estimates agree well with those from an existing spatially explicit method based on inverse prediction. A variety of additional spatially explicit models are fitted; these include models with temporal stratification, behavioral response, and heterogeneous animal home ranges. {\textcopyright} 2008, The International Biometric Society.},

abstract = {Natal dispersal is of central interest when determining demography and genetic structure of populations and managing endangered, species with fragmented distributions. However, methodological limitations linked to spatial and temporal constraints have prevented studies of natal dispersal in long-lived birds. Moreover, the consequences of natal dispersal have mainly been related to the first breeding attempt rather than to lifetime reproductive success. We studied the causes and fitness consequences of natal dispersal in a population of Black Kites at Do{\~{n}}ana National Park (southern Spain). From 1986 to 1995 we marked 2929 nestlings with plastic numbered bands. We annually monitored marked birds in breeding territories, their breeding success, and the survival of nonbreeding birds. Additionally, we searched for marked birds in broad areas of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Median natal dispersal distance was 4.8 km (N = 285), with males more of ten dispersing shorter distances and females dispersing at all distance categories equally. Density of conspecifics negatively affected dispersal distances of both males and females. In addition, single and first-hatched males born in areas with high breeding density dispersed shorter distances. Dispersal distances tended to be correlated between siblings, possibly a result of sharing similar environmental conditions. We did not find evidence that dispersal was an active mechanism aimed to prevent close inbreeding. Patterns of dispersal in this population are probably driven by intraspecific competition. Males that dispersed shorter distances showed higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS). LRS did not differ among females dispersing different distances, but females that dispersed farther mated with more experienced males. These sex differences in dispersal patterns and their consequences may be explained by the inequality between sexes in breeding roles in this species. Familiarity with the natal area could be important for males, which defend territories and resources, while females may increase their fitness through mate choice and breeding dispersal. High levels of philopatry in Do{\~{n}}ana National Park may be a result of a surplus of food resources and the effects of conspecific attraction in densely populated areas. However, the degree of philopatry may vary between populations and with time, subject to differences in ecological pressures.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to conduct an independent analysis of all existing geographic profiling software packages to determine if anyone is more accurate than the others or if any of the software systems are any more accurate than simple spatial distribution strategies at locating the home base of serial offenders. Design/methodology/approach - An analysis was conducted of all existing geographic profiling software as well as three spatial distribution methods of profiling. Differences in accuracy were assessed using four different methods: dichotomous profile accuracy, simple error measurement, profile error distance, and average top profile area. Findings - Results indicate that not only are the different profiling software systems no more accurate than the spatial distribution control methods, but that accuracy in general was marginal at best. In addition results indicated that certain crimes, such as commercial robbery, were particularly difficult to profile and that the number of crimes in a series was not by itself a good indicator of success of a profile. Research limitations/implications - The paper shows that future research needs to focus more on determining how various factors such as city type, crime type, road network and spatial aspects of a crime series (dispersion and search area) impact profiling accuracy. In addition future research should also endeavor to determine whether these advanced strategies are substantially more accurate than other simple profiling strategies such as human prediction. Finally, future research should also seek to examine geographic profiling in a real world setting and how geographic profiling impacts the succes of open investigations Practical implications- Practically, this study casts doubt not only on the overall accuracy of profiling strategies in predicting the likely home location of an offender, but also on whether probability strategies are substantially better than spatial distribution strategies. Originality/value - This research was the first to independently analyze all of the existing geographic profiling systems against control methods for the purpose of determining the accuracy of these different methods.},

abstract = {Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus Skuse mosquitoes transmit serious human arboviral diseases including yellow fever, dengue and chikungunya in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. Females of the two species have adapted to undergo preimaginal development in natural or artificial collections of freshwater near human habitations and feed on human blood. While there is an effective vaccine against yellow fever, the control of dengue and chikungunya is mainly dependent on reducing freshwater preimaginal development habitats of the two vectors. We show here that Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus lay eggs and their larvae survive to emerge as adults in brackish water (water with <0.5 ppt or parts per thousand, 0.5-30 ppt and >30 ppt salt are termed fresh, brackish and saline respectively). Brackish water with salinity of 2 to 15 ppt in discarded plastic and glass containers, abandoned fishing boats and unused wells in coastal peri-urban environment were found to contain Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus larvae. Relatively high incidence of dengue in Jaffna city, Sri Lanka was observed in the vicinity of brackish water habitats containing Ae. aegypti larvae. These observations raise the possibility that brackish water-adapted Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus may play a hitherto unrecognized role in transmitting dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever in coastal urban areas. National and international health authorities therefore need to take the findings into consideration and extend their vector control efforts, which are presently focused on urban freshwater habitats, to include brackish water larval development habitats. {\textcopyright} 2011 Ramasamy et al.},

This framework describes the relationships between park benefits, park use, and physical activity, and the antecedents/correlates of park use. In this classification scheme, the discussion focuses on park environmental characteristics that could be related to physical activity, including park features, condition, access, aesthetics, safety, and policies. Data for these categories should be collected within specific geographic areas in or around the park, including activity areas, supporting areas, the overall park, and the surrounding neighborhood. Future research should focus on how to operationalize specific measures and methodologies for collecting data, as well as measuring associations between individual physical activity levels and specific park characteristics.

abstract = {Background Urban development projects can be costly and have health impacts. An evidence-based approach to urban planning is therefore essential. However, the evidence for physical and non-physical health benefits of urban green space is unclear. Methods A literature search of academic and grey literature was conducted for studies and reviews of the health effects of green space. Articles found were appraised for their relevance, critically reviewed and graded accordingly. Their findings were then thematically categorized. Results There is weak evidence for the links between physical, mental health and well-being, and urban green space. Environmental factors such as the quality and accessibility of green space affects its use for physical activity. User determinants, such as age, gender, ethnicity and the perception of safety, are also important. However, many studies were limited by poor study design, failure to exclude confounding, bias or reverse causality and weak statistical associations. ConclusionMost studies reported findings that generally supported the view that green space have a beneficial health effect. Establishing a causal relationship is difficult, as the relationship is complex. Simplistic urban interventions may therefore fail to address the underlying determinants of urban health that are not remediable by landscape redesign. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity rates in the USA show distinct geographical patterns. The present study used spatial cluster detection methods and individual-level data to locate obesity clusters and to analyse them in relation to the neighbourhood built environment.\n\nMETHODS: The 2008-2009 Seattle Obesity Study provided data on the self-reported height, weight, and sociodemographic characteristics of 1602 King County adults. Home addresses were geocoded. Clusters of high or low body mass index were identified using Anselin's Local Moran's I and a spatial scan statistic with regression models that searched for unmeasured neighbourhood-level factors from residuals, adjusting for measured individual-level covariates. Spatially continuous values of objectively measured features of the local neighbourhood built environment (SmartMaps) were constructed for seven variables obtained from tax rolls and commercial databases.\n\nRESULTS: Both the Local Moran's I and a spatial scan statistic identified similar spatial concentrations of obesity. High and low obesity clusters were attenuated after adjusting for age, gender, race, education and income, and they disappeared once neighbourhood residential property values and residential density were included in the model.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Using individual-level data to detect obesity clusters with two cluster detection methods, the present study showed that the spatial concentration of obesity was wholly explained by neighbourhood composition and socioeconomic characteristics. These characteristics may serve to more precisely locate obesity prevention and intervention programmes.},

This paper reports on a systematic review of quantitative research examining the association between objectively measured access to greenspace and (i) Physical activity, (ii) Weight status and (iii) Health conditions related to elevated weight. Literature searches were conducted in SCOPUS, Medline, Embase and PYSCHINFO. Sixty studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed for methodological quality and strength of the evidence. The majority (68%) of papers found a positive or weak association between greenspace and obesity-related health indicators, but findings were inconsistent and mixed across studies. Several studies found the relationship varied by factors such as age, socioeconomic status and greenspace measure. Developing a theoretical framework which considers the correlates and interactions between different types of greenspace and health would help study design and interpretation of reported findings, as would improvement in quality and consistency of greenspace access measures. Key areas for future research include investigating if and how people actually use greenspace and improving understanding of the mechanisms through which greenspace can improve health and, in particular, if physical activity is one such mechanism.},

abstract = {Community assembly rules have been extensively studied, but its association with regional environmental variation, while land use history remains largely unexplored. Land use history might be especially important in Mediterranean forests, considering their historical deforestation and recent afforestation. Using forest inventories and historical (1956) and recent (2000) land cover maps, we explored the following hypotheses: 1) woody species assembly is driven by environmental factors, but also by historical landscape attributes; 2) recent forests exhibit lower woody species richness than pre-existing due to the existence of colonization credits; 3) these credits are modulated by species' life-forms and dispersal mechanisms. We examined the association of forest historical type (pre-existing versus recent) with total species richness and that of diverse life-forms and dispersal groups, also considering the effects of current environment and past landscape factors. When accounting for these effects, no significant differences in woody species richness were found between forest historical types except for vertebrate-dispersed species. Species richness of this group was affected by the interaction of forest historical type with distance to coast and rainfall: vertebrate-dispersed species richness increased with rainfall and distance to the coast in recent forests, while it was higher in dryer sites in pre-existing forests. In addition, forest historical types showed differences in woody species composition associated to diverse environmental and past landscape factors. In view of these results we can conclude that: 1) community assembly in terms of species richness is fast enough to exhaust most colonization credit in recent Mediterranean forests except for vertebrate-dispersed species; 2) for these species, colonization credit is affected by the interplay of forest history and a set of proxies of niche and landscape constraints of species dispersal and establishment; 3) woody species assemblage is mostly shaped by the species' ecological niches in these forests.},

In this study, we used a Hidden Markov Model to characterise seed dormancy, colonisation and germination solely from the presence-absence of standing flora. Applying the model to data from a long-term survey of 38 annual weeds across France, we identified three homogeneous functional groups: (1) species persisting preferentially through spatial colonisation, (2) species persisting preferentially through seed dormancy and (3) a mix of both strategies. These groups are consistent with existing ecological knowledge, demonstrating that ecologically meaningful parameters can be estimated from simple presence-absence observations. These results indicate that such studies could contribute to the design of weed management strategies. They also open the possibility of testing life-history theories such as the dormancy/colonisation trade-off in natura.},

abstract = {Aim: Geological barriers within a species range play a key role in
shaping patterns of genetic variation by restricting gene flow. Mountain
ranges are particularly imposing barriers responsible for creating
genetic differentiation across multiple taxa, from small amphibians to
large mammals and birds. Here, we examined the population structure of
North American barn owls (Tyto alba) and investigated whether the Rocky
Mountains influence gene flow and dispersal at the continental scale.
Location: Continental North America.
Methods: We collected 292 museum samples covering the species range,
genotyped them at 20 microsatellite markers and sequenced 410 bp of the
mitochondrial gene ND6. Population and landscape genetics tools were
used to study range-wide patterns of structure and identify gene flow
barriers. Ring recapture data were also analysed to investigate
individual movement patterns and frequency of exchanges between both
sides of the Rocky Mountains.
Results: We found faint overall genetic structure, which is consistent
with barn owl's high mobility across its continuous range. Nonetheless,
we identified two distinct genetic groups on the western and eastern
regions of the Rocky Mountains with a likely contact point through the
narrow southern pass between them and the Sierra Madre Occidental in
Mexico. Accordingly, most recaptured barn owls remain on the same side
of the mountains. The Rockies appear to significantly isolate the
populations in the west, which, as a consequence, display lower genetic
diversity than their counterparts to the east.
Main conclusions: The Rocky Mountains appear to constrain barn owl
dispersal and gene flow. Our study supports the hypothesis that regional
landscape barriers can shape gene flow and population structure even in
highly mobile organisms.},

abstract = {Although landscape spatial structure is known to influence spatial
patterns of biodiversity, its effect on insect communities at higher
trophic levels such as parasitoids remains poorly understood. This is
particularly true in continuously distributed forests in which it can be
difficult to identify clear boundaries among habitat patches. Using the
metacommunity framework, we evaluate the relative importance of forest
landscape structure, non-environmental spatial structure, and host
outbreak status to spatial and within-season temporal variation in
parasitoid communities. We used variation partitioning and metacommunity
structure analyses to identify (1) the drivers of the metacommunity
structure of parasitoids associated with the spruce budworm
(Choristoneura fumiferana), and (2) how their relative influence varies
through a season. We used a multi-scale perspective to summarize
landscape heterogeneity in regions of increasing size around the
community sampling locations. Spruce budworm larvae and pupae were
sampled during three periods during the summer 2014 in 18 locations
within continuous forest landscapes in Quebec, Canada. Thirty-two
parasitoid wasp and fly species were recorded, 16 of which were found at
more than one location. We found that the mechanisms shaping
metacommunity structure changed over the course of a single season and
that community structure varied among sites. At early and late periods
in the season, we found that non-environmental structure, forest
structure, and likely inter-specific competition were the main
mechanisms influencing spatial variation in community structure. These
results suggest a competition-dispersal trade-off. In contrast, at the
middle period of the season, environmental filtering by forest structure
and stochastic events were found to influence community structure. This
period corresponds to the transition between early and late parasitoid
communities. Our findings on the role of environmental filtering and
forest structure support the idea that forest manipulations have the
potential to influence parasitoid populations and hence spruce budworm
outbreak dynamics as hypothesized by the enemies hypothesis. Moreover,
our study highlights the value of considering a multi-scale approach and
temporal variability of species interactions when characterizing the
multiple processes shaping spatial metacommunity structure, particularly
in continuous environments.},

mechanisms shaping the assembly of soil microbial communities. Despite
the importance of bacterial and fungal mediation of carbon cycling in
forest ecosystems, knowledge concerning their distribution patterns and
underlying mechanisms remains insufficient. Here, soils were sampled
from six bamboo forests across the main planting area of Moso bamboo in
southern China. The bacterial and fungal diversities were assessed by
sequencing 16S rRNA and ITS gene amplicons, respectively, with an
Illumina MiSeq. Based on structural equationmodelling, dispersal
limitation had strongest impact on bacterial beta diversity, while the
mean annual precipitation had a smaller impact by directly or indirectly
mediating the soil organic carbon density. However, only the mean annual
temperature and precipitation played direct roles in fungal beta
diversity. Moreover, the co-occurrence network analyses revealed a
possibly much higher network connectivity in the fungal network than in
the bacteria. With less dispersal limitation, stronger environmental
selection and a potentially more connected network, the fungal community
had more important roles in the soil carbon metabolisms in bamboo
forests. Fungal beta diversity and the clustering coefficient explained
approximately 14.4% and 6.1% of the variation in the carbon metabolic
profiles among sites, respectively, but that of bacteria only explained
approximately 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. This study explored soil
microbial spatial patterns along with the underlying mechanisms of

evidence that movement rates and patterns may vary among different

switch between two distinct dispersal modes. We study models for

of diffusion and whose local population dynamics are subject to density
dependence of logistic type. The resulting models are reaction-diffusion
systems that can be cooperative at some population densities and
competitive at others. We assume that the focal population inhabits a

parameters describing switching rates and local population dynamics.

simulations of the same model, the specialists dominate in landscapes of
high quality, whereas generalists thrive in landscapes of intermediate

exogenous factors. In territorial, polygynous species like tigers
(Panthera tigris), males often center their space-use around female
territories, repelling competitors from these areas. Competition among
males for females leads to increased mortality of both sexes and
infanticide of unrelated cubs, which can lead to population declines. We
hypothesized that increased territorial overlap among adult male tigers
and elevated levels of inter and intra-sex competition would be manifest
in populations with male-biased adult sex ratios (ASR). We also assessed
whether inter-sex variation in adult survival or degree of habitat
connectivity resulted in skewed ASR. We evaluated these hypotheses using
camera trap data from three tiger populations occupying habitat patches
with varying levels of connectivity and ASRs. Data were analyzed using
multi-state occupancy models, where states were defined as habitat use
by one or more male tigers in sites with and without female use. As
predicted, in populations with male-biased or even ASR we found evidence
for increased spatial overlap between male tigers, particularly
pronounced in areas adjacent to female territories. Given parity in
adult survival, habitat fragmentation likely caused male-biased ASR. Our
results suggest that the persistence of small tiger populations in
habitat patches with male-biased ASR may be significantly compromised by
behavior-mediated endogenous demographic processes that are often
overlooked. In habitat fragments with pronounced male biased ASR,
population recovery of territorial carnivores may require timely
supplementation of individuals to compensate for population losses from

system, we characterized the microsites of seed arrival of eight
fleshy-fruited plant species dispersed by five mammal species during two
consecutive seasons across three sites in a Mediterranean environment
(n=383 feces with seeds; 261 453 seeds). We evaluated spatial and
temporal variations in the probability of a seed to arrive at open
microsites or at microsites with varying plant cover, considering
selection by frugivores and assessing the extent to which seeds of
particular species arrived under conspecifics or heterospecifics. We
found strong spatio-temporal variations in the amounts of seeds of the
eight target species arriving at different microsites. These variations
were strongly driven by frugivores' selection of different landscape
elements (i.e. open areas and microsites dominated by different plant
species), which differed from expectations based on their local
availability. In general, more seeds than expected arrived at vacant
(open) microsites. Using bipartite network graphs to connect seeds with
their arrival microsites, we found that the proportion of seeds of
fleshy-fruited species arriving near conspecifics or heterospecifics, or
at vacant microsites, varied depending on the target plant species, but
also on the frugivore species dispersing it, on the study site and on
the dispersal season. Our study revealed marked spatio-temporal
variations in the microsites of seed arrival, which will potentially
have implications for the quality of dispersal effectiveness, ultimately
affecting plant population dynamics and community structure. Such a

long-lasting biogenic material (i.e., shell hash) on benthic systems are
poorly understood. We measured percent cover values of 4 bottom cover
types, i.e., live mussels, whole shells, fragmented shells, and bare
sediment, at the mussel bed in Carrying Place Cove, Harrington, Maine,
USA, and examined their effects on sediment characteristics, community
structure of macrofauna and meiofauna, and ecosystem processes of
sediment flux and dispersal of postlarval macrofauna and meiofauna. We
predicted that live mussels are the cover type with the greatest effects
compared to bare sediment, followed by fragmented shells and then whole
shells. We discovered mostly bare sediment, substantial cover of whole
and fragmented shells, and almost no live mussels in what had in past
years been a robust bed. We found significant univariate and
multivariate differences in sediment and animals across cover types,
especially for meiofauna. Fragmented shell material in particular may be
an important driver in this system. Our results are the first to
quantify the 4 mussel bed cover types and demonstrate their effects.
Mussel beds in the Gulf of Maine have experienced severe declines in the

one or the other habitat type. Assuming localised dispersal, so the
offspring tend to settle in similar habitat to the natal type, the
superior competitive ability of offspring remaining in the rarer habitat
hampers immigration from the majority habitat. This initiates a positive
feedback between local adaptation and trait divergence, which can
thereafter be reinforced by coevolution with dispersal traits that match
ecotype to habitat type. Rarity strengthens selection on dispersal
traits and promotes linkage disequilibrium between locally adapted
traits and ecotype-habitat matching dispersal. We propose that carryover

Furthermore, approaches such as genotyping by sequencing (GBS) provide unprecedented power for resolving genetic differences among species and populations. We therefore used GBS to provide a genomewide perspective on the comparative population structure of two palm genera, Washingtonia and Brahea, on the Baja California peninsula, a region of high landscape and ecological complexity. First, we used phylogenetic analysis to address taxonomic uncertainties among five currently recognized species. We resolved three main clades, the first corresponding to W.robusta and W.filifera, the second to B.brandegeei and B.armata, and the third to B.edulis from Guadalupe Island. Focusing on the first two clades, we then delved deeper by investigating the underlying population structure. Striking differences were found, with GBS uncovering four distinct Washingtonia populations and identifying a suite of loci associated with temperature, consistent with ecologically mediated divergence. By contrast, individual mountain ranges could be resolved in Brahea and few loci were associated with environmental variables, implying a more prominent role of neutral divergence. Finally, evidence was found for long-distance dispersal events in Washingtonia but not Brahea, in line with knowledge of the dispersal mechanisms of these palms including the possibility of human-mediated dispersal. Overall, our study demonstrates the power of GBS together with a comparative approach to elucidate markedly different patterns of genomewide divergence mediated by multiple effectors.},

major patterns of diversity and biogeography during this time remain
unresolved. Previous estimates suggest that global tetrapod diversity
rose continuously across this interval and that habitat fragmentation
following the `Carboniferous rainforest collapse' (CRC) drove increased
endemism among communities. However, previous work failed to adequately
account for spatial and temporal biases in sampling. Here, we reassess
early tetrapod diversity and biogeography with a new global

biogeography methods. Our results support a tight relationship between
observed richness and sampling, particularly during the Carboniferous.
We found that subsampled species richness initially increased into the
late Carboniferous, then decreased substantially across the
Carboniferous/Permian boundary before slowly recovering in the early
Permian. Our analysis of biogeography does not support the hypothesis
that the CRC drove endemism; instead, we found evidence for increased
cosmopolitanism in the early Permian. While a changing environment may
have played a role in reducing diversity in the earliest Permian, our
results suggest that the CRC was followed by increased global
connectivity between communities, possibly reflecting both reduced
barriers to dispersal and the diversification of amniotes.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity is increasingly threatened by land-use change, but
the direct and indirect drivers of species diversity in human-modified
tropical landscapes are poorly known. Forest-dependent species are
expected to be particularly sensitive to changes in landscape
composition (e.g., forest loss) and configuration (e.g., increase of
forest edges), both directly and indirectly through cascading landscape
effects on local patterns of forest structure and resource availability.
In contrast, non-forest-dependent species are probably more strongly
related to landscape changes than to local forest patterns, as these
species are able to use resources not only from the forest, but also
from other landscape elements over larger spatial scales. We tested
these hypotheses using structural equation modeling. In particular, we
sampled 20 landscapes (115 ha each) from the Brazilian Atlantic
rainforest to assess the effect of landscape-scale forest cover and
amount of forest edges on the diversity of frugivorous birds, both
directly and indirectly through the effect that these landscape
variables may have on vegetation complexity and fruit biomass. We
separately assessed the response of forest-dependent and
non-forest-dependent frugivores to infer potential mechanisms underlying
bird assemblages in fragmented landscapes. The diversity of
forest-dependent birds mainly decreased with the simplification of
vegetation complexity in more deforested landscapes, but increased with
increasing fruit biomass in more forested landscapes (indirect effects).
Both patterns were significant, thus supporting a strong bottom-up
control, i.e., local habitat simplification and resource scarcity in
highly deforested landscapes limits the maintenance of forest-dependent
birds. Conversely, but as expected, non-forest-dependent birds were more
strongly and directly related to landscape-scale patterns. In
particular, landscapes with higher forest edge amount showed higher bird
species diversity, probably because the increasing length of ecotones
and interspersion/juxtaposition of different habitat types in landscapes
with more forest edges can increase resource availability and foraging
efficiency of non-forest-dependent birds. As the seed dispersal services
offered by forest-dependent species cannot be ecologically compensated
for by the proliferation of non-forest-dependent species, preventing
forest loss is imperative to maintain forest-dependent birds and forest
regeneration in this vanishing biodiversity hotspot.},

filtering), biological (seed limitation, species interactions) and
stochastic factors may affect successional trajectories and rates. While
functional traits are commonly used to study processes that influence
plant community assembly in late successional communities, few studies
have applied them to primary succession. The objective here was to
determine the importance of these factors in shaping early plant
community assembly on a glacial outwash plain, Skeioararsandur, in SE
Iceland using a trait based approach. We used data on vascular plant
assemblages at two different spatial scales (community and neighborhood)
sampled in 2005 and 2012, and compiled a dataset on seven functional
traits linked to species dispersal abilities, establishment, and
persistence for all species within these assemblages. Trait-based null
model analyses were used to determine the processes that influenced
plant community assembly from the regional species pool into local
communities, and to determine if the importance of these processes in
community assembly was dependent on local environment or changed with
time. On the community scale, for most traits, random processes
dominated the assembly from the regional species pool. However, in some
communities, there was evidence of non-random assembly in relation to
traits linked to species dispersal abilities, persistence, and
establishment. On the neighborhood scale, assembly was mostly random.
The relative importance of different processes varied spatially and
temporally and the variation was linked to local soil conditions. While
stochasticity dominated assembly patterns of our early successional
communities, there was evidence of both seed limitation and
environmental filtering. Our results indicated that as soil conditions
improved, environmental constraints on assembly became weaker and the
assembly became more dependent on species availability.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the spatial structure of individual variation is
critical to assessing the mechanisms and scale of species-level
ecological and evolutionary responses. But the continuity and complexity
of streams can make it difficult to discern spatial structure, and data
on individual variation spanning spatial scales are rare.
2. Our goal was to objectively resolve the scale of ecological and
evolutionary processes affecting the salamander Gyrinophilus
porphyriticus by testing for spatial structure in individual variation
across a headwater stream network. We used 3 years of spatially explicit
capture mark recapture data from four headwater streams in the Hubbard
Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, to test for individual
variation in survival at three scales: (a) among c. 2-km(2) watersheds,
(b) in 500-m downstream and upstream reaches within watersheds and (c)
in riffle and pool habitats along reaches. We also tested for
corresponding spatial variation in individual body condition and
morphology to gain insight on the causes and implications of variation
in survival.
3. Survival of G. porphyriticus larvae was constant among watersheds,
but differed by reach and habitat. Larval survival was higher in
upstream reaches than downstream reaches, matching the distribution of
predatory brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), which were restricted to
down-stream reaches. Larval survival was also higher in pools than
riffles. Survival of G. porphyriticus adults was constant at all scales.
4. Larval body condition was higher in downstream reaches than upstream
reaches. Both larvae and adults differed in morphology at the habitat
scale: individuals in pools had longer limbs than individuals in
riffles.
5. Negative covariation in larval survival and body condition at the
reach scale suggests that there is a trade-off between fitness and
proximate performance along streams. The surprising differences between
habitats in survival and morphology show the potential for fine-scale
ecology evolution interactions in streams, potentially driven by
differences in flow and gradient conditions in riffles and pools.
6. Our results suggest that the larval stage is key to understanding
individual, population and community-level processes affecting G.
porphyriticus. More broadly, this research provides a novel empirical
link between traditional studies of fine-scale ecological complexity in
streams and recent studies showing consistent spatial dynamics at the
network scale. By documenting differences in survival, body condition
and morphology at reach and habitat scales, we hope this work shows the
feasibility and value of spatially explicit approaches to species-level
ecological and evolutionary questions in streams.},

Second, faeces of the predominant scavengers (corvids) commonly contained viable seeds of crowberry, a keystone species of the alpine tundra with predominantly vegetative reproduction.

abstract = {Microbes colonizing a surface often experience colony growth dynamics
characterized by an initial phase of spatial clonal expansion followed
by collision between neighboring colonies to form potentially
genetically heterogeneous boundaries. For species with life cycles
consisting of repeated surface colonization and dispersal, these
spatially explicit expansion-collision dynamics generate periodic
transitions between two distinct selective regimes, expansion
competition and boundary competition, each one favoring a different
growth strategy. We hypothesized that this dynamic could promote stable
coexistence of expansion- and boundary-competition specialists by
generating time-varying, negative frequency-dependent selection that
insulates both types from extinction. We tested this experimentally in
budding yeast by competing an exoenzyme secreting cooperator strain
(expansion-competition specialists) against nonsecreting defectors
(boundary-competition specialists). As predicted, we observed
cooperator-defector coexistence or cooperator dominance with
expansion-collision dynamics, but only defector dominance otherwise.
Also as predicted, the steady-state frequency of cooperators was
determined by colonization density (the average initial cell-cell
distance) and cost of cooperation. Lattice-based spatial simulations
give good qualitative agreement with experiments, supporting our
hypothesis that expansion-collision dynamics with costly public goods
production is sufficient to generate stable cooperator-defector
coexistence. This mechanism may be important for maintaining
public-goods cooperation and conflict in microbial pioneer species
living on surfaces.},

changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island
effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts
towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also
characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for
dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which
spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-mothsan
insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal linksat both the
community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part
of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite
the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth
communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean
body size because of stronger filtering against small species along
urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards
increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These
results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and
hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low
connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are
a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is
central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic
change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of
nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that
urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and
coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate
that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m
radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local
and landscape scales (50-3,200m radius), depending on the species.
Hence, measuressuch as creating and improving urban green

abstract = {1. Efforts to describe spatial patterns of freshwater diversity and to
evaluate their underlying factors have traditionally been focused on
some animal groups (e.g. amphibians, fish or dragonflies). Despite being
a dominant component in continental aquatic ecosystems and crucial for
determining priority areas for conservation, broad-scale data on
gastropod total species, endemic and threatened species richness are
limited. Based on these biodiversity indices, we identify global
hotspots, extinction risk along the elevational gradient and the drivers
of species richness patterns in the largest group of freshwater
gastropods, the family Hydrobiidae.
2. Given the strong dependency to a non marine aquatic environment, the
observed richness patterns of extant hydrobiid species could be
significantly influenced by large-scale geography and dispersal
processes as well as climatic conditions affecting continental
ecosystems. Therefore, we tested several predictions for species
richness derived from ecological and evolutionary hypotheses postulated
for other freshwater groups.
3. Based on a comprehensive literature and biodiversity database review,
we compiled the number of total, endemic and threatened species per
freshwater ecoregion. We classified ecoregions as hotspots if each
biodiversity index was in the top 25% of its range and assessed the
effect of 13 environmental and evolutionary factors on species richness
using generalised linear models.
4. We identified 906 species and 157 genera of Hydrobiidae showing
mainly a Nearctic-Palearctic distribution and 19 biodiversity hotspots,
most located across the Mediterranean Basin. In our data set, 83% of
the species were endemic to a single ecoregion. Of the 43% non-data
deficient species, we found almost three times more threatened than
non-threatened species, and extinction risk peaked at 1,500 m a.s.l.
Species richness was unequally distributed over biogeographic realms,
increased with higher connectivity among ecoregions, and was negatively
related with annual temperature range. Latitude and precipitation
seasonality explained part of the richness variation by a nonlinear
relationship.
5. The identified hotspots correspond with those of other freshwater
taxa. The hump-shaped relationship of extinction risk with elevation is
likely the consequence of decreasing natural and anthropogenic
perturbations at higher elevations. Global hotspots of Hydrobiidae
richness represent areas of climatic stability with medium precipitation
and temperature seasonality that are well connected with other
hydrological basins. Our results illustrate that both evolutionary and
environmental factors determine these global patterns and that future
changes of the latter factors may affect hydrobiid richness.},

found 19.1-34.4% UD overlap when capture locations were used to group
individuals, but there was no UD overlap for bears across different

abstract = {The spatial distribution of suitable environmental conditions defines a
species habitat, and colonization-extinction dynamics within this
habitat determine the distribution of species populations. In addition,
the success of colonization and the risk of extinction are expected to
be influenced by the proximity to habitat boundary. We address here the
influence of boundary vicinity for a contact-process model of population
dynamics in a percolating habitat lattice. To separate the influence of
boundary vicinity from that of fragment area, we investigate population
dynamics in the very large spanning cluster of the percolating habitat.
The geometry of the spanning cluster varies when habitat density in the
lattice is tuned away from the percolation threshold. We expect that the
colonization success decreases closer to the boundary, leading to
depleted site occupancy in the cluster, and that this effect is even
more pronounced near the extinction threshold of the contact process.
For the set of suitable sites of the cluster and unsuitable sites next
to its boundary, we quantify the boundary density, sigma, as the
probability to draw a pair of suitable and unsuitable sites. The cluster
boundary is most rugged and a is maximal close to the percolation
threshold of the habitat. We expect that the global influence of
boundary on population dynamics in the cluster is greater when the
boundary is more rugged. We thus investigate population dynamics in the
spanning cluster for varying values of sigma. We determine the
stationary properties of population dynamics in the spanning cluster
according to sigma and to the species-specific ratio of extinction and
colonization rates, denoted r. Using both numerical simulations and a
pair-approximation model, we assess global species persistence and site
occupancy patterns in the spanning cluster. We show that the extinction
threshold r(c) depends crucially on sigma, i.e., increasing sigma limits
global species persistence. Furthermore, increasing sigma decreases the
probability of site occupancy in the spanning cluster. A key result is
that this influence extends to sites far from the boundary when r gets
close to r(c). Therefore, species that are at risk of extinction are
more sensitive to the influence of habitat boundary. These results are
of both theoretical and practical interest for understanding and
forecasting species viability in heterogeneous and fragmented habitats.},

abstract = {Aim: We explored the factors between riverscape features and exotic
introgression of cultured rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that drive
the current genetic structure in the endemic Mexican golden trout
(Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) using a riverscape genetics simulator.
Location: Sierra Madre Occidental, Northwest Mexico, North America.
Methods: We created a system model for Mexican golden trout to test
various scenarios for the effect of riverscape resistance and rainbow
trout introgression on the native genetic structure of the Mexican
golden trout. Individual genotypes were used to initialize the model and
were based upon empirical allele frequencies from three genetically and
spatially distinct groups in the study area. The geographical location
of the simulated populations was defined using a species distribution
model. We included hypotheses for movement of riverine distance and
riverscape resistance. We evaluated model performance by conducting
population and landscape genetics analyses on the simulation outputs.
Results: The most plausible scenario included riverscape resistance
without introgression, which presented a spatial genetic structure
matching the observed riverscape genetic structure and fitting expected
general life-history patterns for high elevation trout streams. In
addition, temperature, precipitation, hydrology and topography were the
most important variables influencing species occurrence and dispersal.
Main conclusion: This work presents one of the first empirically derived
simulation studies of introgression. It highlights the importance of
considering riverscape resistance (i.e. hydroclimatic and topographical
gradient effects) in models of spatial genetic structure and
introgression. Moreover, our modelling suggests that what we
characterize as riverscape resistance is acting as a boundary against
exotic introgression. The results of this study could help to develop
management strategies that preserve native gene pools.},

abstract = {1. Mountain pine beetles (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) are
aggressive insects attacking Pinus host trees. Pines use defensive resin
to overwhelm attackers, creating an Allee effect requiring beetles to
attack en masse to successfully reproduce. MPB kill hosts, leaving
observable, dying trees with red needles. Landscape patterns of
infestation depend on MPB dispersal, which decreases with host density.
Away from contiguously impacted patches (low beetle densities),
infestations are characterized by apparently random spots (of 1-10
trees).
2. It remains unclear whether the new spots are spatially random
eruptions of a locally endemic population or a mode of MPB spread, with
spatial distribution determined by beetle motility and the need to
overcome the Allee effect.
3. To discriminate between the hypothesis of population spread versus
independent eruption, a model of spot formation by dispersing beetles
facing a local Allee effect is derived. The model gives rise to an
inverse power distribution of travel times from existing outbreaks.
Using landscape-level host density maps in three study areas, an
independently calibrated model of landscape resistance depending on host
density, and aerial detection surveys, we calculated yearly maps of
travel time to previous beetle impact. Isolated beetle spots were sorted
by travel time and compared with predictions. Random eruption of locally
endemic populations was tested using artificially seeded spots. We also
evaluated the relationship between number of new spots and length of the
perimeter of previously infested areas.
4. Spot distributions conformed strongly to predicted power-law
behaviour. The spatially random eruption hypothesis was found to be
highly improbable. Spot numbers grew consistently with perimeter of
previously infested area, suggesting that MPB spread long distances from
infestation boundaries via spots following an inverse power
distribution.
5. The Allee effect in MPB therefore accelerates, rather than limits,
invasion rates, contributing to recent widespread landscape-scale
mortality in western North America.},

pathways in Pinus contorta subsp. latifolia Douglas ex Loudon forests?
Location: Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada.
Methods: We used five 1-ha long-term permanent plots,
dendrochronological stand reconstruction and detailed spatial analysis
of stem-mapped data.
Results: Establishment of shade-intolerant species mainly occurred
within 20 years post-fire but important later recruitment of these
species was observed in the drier plots, primarily in gaps in stands
that had more open canopies. Shade-tolerant species established quickly
following fires on moister sites but, despite apparent seed source
availability after the stand-initiating fire, their establishment was
delayed in the drier sites, most likely due to moisture limitations.
Shade-tolerant regeneration was clustered around shade-tolerant trees
that had established immediately post-disturbance; this suggests the
latter served as seed sources and perhaps created favourable microsites
for establishment.
Conclusion: Competition for light, dispersal limitation and moisture
limitations were all processes influencing regeneration and successional
pathways in these P. contorta stands. Although initial studies in these
stands had suggested some of the stands could potentially be
self-perpetuating P.contorta forests, our results suggest that all plots
studied will likely transition towards dominance of shade-tolerant
species. However the rate of this transition will likely be slower in
the drier sites compared to the moister sites since the density of
shade-tolerant regeneration was much lower in these sites and took
longer to establish (ca. 70-90 years) post-disturbance.},

live strandings from 1984-2015 to gain insights into demographic and
environmental factors underlying threats to sea otter recovery. Using
multinomial logistic regression to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of
stranding causes, we demonstrate that increases in stranding rates,
particularly outside the range center, are related to a substantial
increase in shark bites. By contrast, trauma linked to human activities
has declined dramatically, and now accounts for less than 5% of
stranding cases. Within the range core, where the sea otter population
seems regulated by prey availability, symptoms of energetic stress
represent more than 63% of all strandings and are strongly associated
with high sea otter density. Conversely, in range peripheries, the
majority of strandings are caused by shark bite and neurological
disease. Notably, these threats are virtually absent where nearshore
habitat is characterized by at least 10% kelp canopy cover. Our
analyses reveal that declining kelp cover may therefore constrain the
population's spatial expansion and recovery in two key ways. Absence of
kelp intensifies density-independent threats in the range peripheries,
and likely limits dispersal of reproductive females, which depend on
kelp canopy for nursery habitat. These results highlight the
significance of both top-down and bottom-up processes in population
dynamics, and inform an ecosystem-based approach to conservation

The spring ephemeral Megaleranthis saniculifolia, endemic to Korea, is
insect-pollinated and has no special seed dispersal mechanism, and its
seedling recruitment is quite low. Given these ecological and
life-history traits, we expect that there would be significant FSGS in
juveniles, which would persist into adult stage. Since M. saniculifolia
is self-compatible and many adults produce 2-3 inflorescences, we expect
considerable inbreeding. To test these predictions, we used
allozyme-based Sp statistics to compare two undisturbed populations on
Mt. Deogyu (DEO) and Mt. Taebaek (TAE), as well as between juveniles (J)
and adults (A) stages. We also measured genetic diversity and inbreeding
in each population. The two populations exhibited significant FSGS in
both life stages. Although the strength of FSGS was reduced with
increasing stage (J, Sp = 0.0313; A, Sp = 0.0178 in DEO and J, Sp =
0.0502; A, Sp = 0.0286 in TAE), differences in FSGS between stages and

diversity (mean %P = 27.0, A = 1.27, H-e = 0.116) was relatively low
and comparable to reference values for both endemic and
narrowly-distributed plant species. Genetic differentiation between
sites, however, was high (F-ST = 0.465), and the two populations
exhibited a significant deficit of heterozygotes (mean P-is = 0.289),
primarily due to selfing and biparental inbreeding (effective selfing
rate was similar to 0.40). Our results revealed that the magnitude and
spatial scale of FSGS in M. saniculifolia is strong and does not differ
significantly with life-history stage. The strong FSGS, low
within-population genetic variation, high between-population genetic

fern fronds and 3,098 climbing stems were reported. For the species-area
relationship, a simple linear regression model (SLR) and two models that
consider the spatial autocorrelation of species richness among
fragments, generalized least squares (GLS) and simultaneous
autoregressive model (SAR), were compared. For the species nestedness,
the nestedness measure based on overlap and decreasing fills (NODF) and
weighted nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill (WNODF)
indexes were used on presence-absence and abundance matrices,
respectively. These matrices were sorted by area size and distance from
the largest fragment and then contrasted with the probability
distribution of a randomized null model based on 10,000 simulations.
Results The results showed that the area size had a significantly
positive effect on epiphyte species richness, while spatial
autocorrelation played a fundamental role in explaining the richness of
climbing plants. Both metacommunities had a general nestedness structure
in terms of species incidence, which was determined first by area size
and secondly by isolation. Main conclusions Our results indicate that
local colonization processes determined by species' dispersal capacities
could be the predominant mechanism for the spatial configuration of
climbing plant species composition. On the other hand, selective
extinction determined by patch size could characterize the spatial

including disease related dispersal patterns, and the benefits of
reducing pathogen significance call for the design of
disease-suppressive landscapes. Model-based assessment is the most
efficient method of choosing among management strategies. Based on a
case study in France, we ranked the effectiveness of different crop
mosaics for control of phoma stem canker on winter oilseed rape (WOSR).
Assessed crop mosaics were developed from strategies defined by local
stakeholders: (1) isolating target from source fields (all WOSR or only
WOSR harbouring RlmX specific resistance), and (2) specifying tillage on
WOSR stubble according to cultivar type (with or without RlmX). Model
simulations highlighted the effectiveness of WOSR-isolation as compared
to RlX-isolation. Our analyses suggest that tillage (mouldboard
ploughing) was the most important factor in explaining the size and
genetic structure of the pathogen population (determinant in explaining
the breakdown of resistance), and yield loss. While the pathogen
population and yield loss decreased with intensive management of
non-RlinX-cultivars (85% of WOSR), the same management with
RlmX-cultivars modified the genetic structure of the pathogen
population. Increasing isolation distances led to reductions in pathogen
population and yield loss only in the strategy of WOSR-isolation.
Isolating source and target RlmX-cultivar had no effect on the evolution
of the population's genetic structure. Although effective in phoma stem
canker control, changing tillage can require significant changes for
farms. Isolation distance would require extensive information on the
landscape, and imply an aggregation of crops that might or might not be
possible depending on a farm's spatial organization. This study could
lead to the design of a Decision Support System targeting high risk
(diseased) WOSR fields to be ploughed or isolated from the following

the Ruika index) and spatial point-pattern analysis to compare the
spatial (i.e., distance-dependent) replacement and nestedness components
of each plot with that expected under five spatiallyexplicit null models
representing different hypotheses on community-assembly mechanisms.
Results: Our analyses revealed complex results. In all eight forests,
spatial community dissimilarity was best explained by species
replacement among local tree assemblages and by a null model based on
dispersal limitation. In contrast, spatial nestedness for large and
small trees was best explained by random placement and habitat
filtering, respectively, in addition to dispersal limitation. However,
interspecific interactions did not contribute to local replacement and
nestedness.
Main conclusions: Species replacement is the predominant process
accounting for spatial community dissimilarity in these temperate
forests and caused largely by local-scale species clustering associated
with dispersal limitation. Nestedness, in contrast, is less prevalent
and primarily associated with larger variation in local species richness
as caused by spatial richness gradients or hotspots' of local species
richness. The novel use of replacement and nestedness measures in point
pattern analysis is a promising approach to assess local-scale
biodiversity patterns and to explore their causes.},

abstract = {Agricultural land use is a primary driver of environmental impacts on
streams. However, the causal processes that shape these impacts operate
through multiple pathways and at several spatial scales. This complexity
undermines the development of more effective management approaches, and
illustrates the need for more in-depth studies to assess the mechanisms
that determine changes in stream biodiversity. Here we present results
of the most comprehensive multi-scale assessment of the biological
condition of streams in the Amazon to date, examining functional
responses of fish assemblages to land use. We sampled fish assemblages
from two large human-modified regions, and characterized stream
conditions by physical habitat attributes and key landscape-change
variables, including density of road crossings (i.e. riverscape
fragmentation), deforestation, and agricultural intensification. Fish
species were functionally characterized using ecomorphological traits
describing feeding, locomotion, and habitat preferences, and these
traits were used to derive indices that quantitatively describe the
functional structure of the assemblages. Using structural equation
modeling, we disentangled multiple drivers operating at different
spatial scales, identifying causal pathways that significantly affect
stream condition and the structure of the fish assemblages.
Deforestation at catchment and riparian network scales altered the
channel morphology and the stream bottom structure, changing the
functional identity of assemblages. Local deforestation reduced the
functional evenness of assemblages (i.e. increased dominance of specific
trait combinations) mediated by expansion of aquatic vegetation cover.
Riverscape fragmentation reduced functional richness, evenness and
divergence, suggesting a trend toward functional homogenization and a
reduced range of ecological niches within assemblages following the loss
of regional connectivity. These results underscore the
often-unrecognized importance of different land use changes, each of
which can have marked effects on stream biodiversity. We draw on the
relationships observed herein to suggest priorities for the improved
management of stream systems in the multiple-use landscapes that
predominate in human-modified tropical forests.},

geographic space, but the mechanisms facilitating or limiting such
overlaps are difficult to resolve. Here, we combine phylogenetic,
morphological and environmental data to model how multiple processes
regulate the origin and maintenance of geographic range overlap across
1,115 pairs of avian sister species globally. We show that coexistence
cannot be adequately predicted by either dispersal-assembly (that is,
biogeographic) models or niche-assembly models alone. Instead, our
results overwhelmingly support an integrated model with different
assembly processes dominating at different stages of coexistence. The
initial attainment of narrow geographic overlap is dictated by intrinsic
dispersal ability and the time available for dispersal, whereas wider
coexistence is largely dependent on niche availability, increasing with
ecosystem productivity and divergence in niche-related traits, and
apparently declining as communities become saturated with species.
Furthermore, although coexistence of any individual pair of species is
highly stochastic, we find that integrating assembly processes allows
broad variation in the incidence and extent of coexistence to be
predicted with reasonable accuracy. Our findings demonstrate how
phylogenetic data coupled with environmental factors and functional

abstract = {1. Connectivity among stream fish populations allows for exchange of
genetic material and helps maintain genetic diversity, adaptive
potential and population stability over time. Changes in species
demographics and population connectivity have the potential to
permanently alter the genetic patterns of stream fish, although these
changes through space and time are variable and understudied in
small-bodied freshwater fish.
2. As a spatially widespread, common species of benthic freshwater fish,
the variegate darter (Etheostoma variatum) is a model species for
documenting how patterns of genetic structure and diversity respond to
increasing isolation due to large dams and how scale of study may shape
our understanding of these patterns. We sampled variegate darters from
34 sites across their range in the North American Ohio River basin and
examined how patterns of genetic structure and diversity within and
between populations responded to historical population changes and dams
within and between populations.
3. Spatial scale and configuration of genetic structure varied across
the eight identified populations, from tributaries within a watershed,
to a single watershed, to multiple watersheds that encompass Ohio River
mainstem habitats. This multiwatershed pattern of population structuring
suggests genetic dispersal across large distances was and may continue
to be common, although some populations remain isolated despite no
apparent structural dispersal barriers. Populations with low effective
population sizes and evidence of past population bottlenecks showed low
allelic richness, but diversity patterns were not related to watershed
size, a surrogate for habitat availability. Pairwise genetic
differentiation (F-ST) increased with fluvial distance and was related
to both historic and contemporary processes. Genetic diversity changes
were influenced by underlying population size and stability, and while
instream barriers were not strong determinants of genetic structuring or
loss of genetic diversity, they reduce population connectivity and may
impact long-term population persistence.
4. The broad spatial scale of this study demonstrated the large spatial
extent of some variegate darter populations and indicated that dispersal
is more extensive than expected given the movement patterns typically
observed for small-bodied, benthic fish. Dam impacts depended on
underlying population size and stability, with larger populations more
resilient to genetic drift and allelic richness loss than smaller
populations.
5. Other darters that inhabit large river habitats may show similar
patterns in landscape-scale studies, and large river barriers may impact
populations of small-bodied fish more than previously expected.
Estimation of dispersal rates and behaviours is critical to conservation
of imperilled riverine species such as darters.},

Australian waters, where this species is taken in recreational and

shortfin mako may constitute a globally panmictic population. There was
generally high genetic connectivity within Australian waters. Assessing
genetic connectivity across the Indian Ocean basin, as well as the
extent that shortfin mako exhibit sex biases in dispersal patterns would
benefit from future improved sampling of adult size classes,

data indicated that Australasian mako are indeed highly migratory and
frequently make long-distance movements. However, individuals also
exhibit fidelity to relatively small geographic areas for extended
periods. Together these patterns suggest that shortfin mako populations
may be genetically homogenous across large geographical areas as a
consequence of few reproductively active migrants, although spatial
partitioning exists. Given that connectivity appears to occur at
different scales, management at both the national and regional levels

reported extraordinary adaptive genetic variation in the MHC B-locus in
wild Red Junglefowl and no evidence of allelic introgression between
wild and domestic chickens was observed. In this study, we characterized
spatial genetic variation and population structure in naturally

population structure varies. We found that Red Junglefowl are widely
distributed but form small and isolated populations. Strong spatial
genetic patterns occur at both local and regional scales. At local
scale, population stratification can be identified to approximately 5km.
At regional scale, we identified distinct populations of Red Junglefowl
in the southern lowlands, northern highlands, and eastern coastal

abstract = {Extensive larval dispersal and a high degree of planktonic cohort mixing were long presumed to disrupt kin aggregations in marine environments. Yet, recent genetic studies of diverse marine taxa have suggested that kin may be found in close proximity to each other after settlement, raising interesting questions about the ecological and behavioral processes that could generate these patterns. We drew on sibship reconstruction to test whether kin cohesion and/or the scale of dispersal could explain patterns of relatedness in the coral reef fish Elacatinus iori. We genotyped 4074 recently settled individuals along a 41 km transect on the Belize Barrier Reef. Because most individuals in the population were unrelated, we found that high-confidence sibling assignments required a large number of microsatellites (>= 55). Using 71 microsatellites, we documented 371 sibling pairs which were non-randomly distributed on the reef: 50% were <= 3 km apart and 99% were <= 18 km apart. The spatial distribution of sibling pairs was congruent with predictions from the limited dispersal hypothesis, and we found no evidence that siblings disperse cohesively. These results underscore the importance of (1) accounting for the relative abundance of different relationship types within a population to accurately identify siblings and (2) carefully applying spatial analyses to discriminate between alternative ecological kin structuring mechanisms. More broadly, this study provides a framework for linking spatial distributions of siblings to the processes that generate them, highlighting the potential for sibship data to provide new insights into marine larval dispersal.},

abstract = {Swimming behaviours and sensory abilities of early pelagic stages play a
prominent role in the life history and ecology of sessile/sedentary
benthic species, with implications for settlement, recruitment and
dispersal. Light is a particularly important driver of navigational
behaviour in the ocean, as a signal of key habitat characteristics
(e.g., depth, shelter). Work to date on phototaxis has largely focused
on planktotrophic larvae that feed during development, and much less on
the larger lecithotrophic larvae that rely on maternal provisions
(yolk). It remains unclear how responses to light might differ among
ciliated propagules of different sizes and nutritional modes. The
present study explored if/how phototactic responses are modulated by
ontogeny (from embryo to larva), nutritional mode and light colour
(wavelength) in ciliated propagules using four co-occurring species of
echinoderms: the sea stars Asterias rubens and Crossaster papposus, the
sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis and the sea cucumber
Cucumaria frondosa. Two types of behavioural responses to stimuli
(white, red, and blue light) were examined: 1) taxis when the light
stimulus was placed at one end of the chamber (net movement towards or
away from the light stimulus) and 2) activity level, using a suite of
swimming metrics, under uniform illumination. All four species
consistently displayed some level of photosensitivity to white light and
responses varied intra- and interspecifically. When the stimulus was red
or blue light, planktotrophs modified their phototactic responses in a
species- and stage-specific manner, while lecithotrophs generally
displayed responses without a clear net direction. Swimming speeds
displayed stage and species-specific variation under constant red or
blue light, but swimming trajectories were consistently straighter under
red light, resulting in greater displacement. Taken together, the
results suggest that propagules of species with different life-history
strategies respond to light stimuli in distinctive stage-wise manners.
Interestingly, ontogenetic patterns were not conserved within
nutritional modes or taxa. Further investigations of species-specific
responses to light might help clarify its roles, in combination with
factors such as buoyancy and gravity, in the ecology of propagules of
benthic invertebrates.},

marked differences between central and peripheral populations in genetic

divergence, these peripheral populations have high evolutionary value
and can influence biogeographic patterns. In tropical marine species
with pelagic larvae, powerful western-boundary currents have great
potential to shape the genetic characteristics of peripheral populations
at latitudinal extremes. We tested for the genetic patterns expected by
the CCPM in peripheral populations that are located within the Kuroshio
Current for the Indo-Pacific reef fish, Caesio cuning. Methods We used a
panel of 2,677 SNPs generated from restriction site-associated DNA (RAD)
sequencing to investigate genetic diversity, relatedness, effective
population size, and spatial patterns of population connectivity from
central to peripheral populations of C. cuning along the Kuroshio
Current. Results Principal component and cluster analyses indicated a
genetically distinct lineage at the periphery of the C. cuning species
range and examination of SNPs putatively under divergent selection
suggested potential for local adaptation in this region. We found
signatures of isolation-by-distance and significant genetic differences
between nearly all sites. Sites closest to the periphery exhibited
increased within-population relatedness and decreased effective
population size. Main Conclusions Despite the potential for homogenizing
gene flow along the Kuroshio Current, peripheral populations in C.
cuning conform to the predictions of the CCPM. While oceanography,
habitat availability, and dispersal ability are all likely to shape the
patterns found in C. cuning across this central-peripheral junction, the
impacts of genetic drift and natural selection in increasing smaller
peripheral populations appear to be probable influences on the lineage

persistence, but quantifying landscape influences and their scale
dependence is challenging. Studies have focused on how environmental
features or global transport networks influence pathogen invasion and
spread, but their influence on local transmission dynamics that underpin
the persistence of endemic diseases remains unexplored. Bayesian
phylogeographic frameworks that incorporate spatial heterogeneities are
promising tools for analysing linked epidemiological, environmental and
genetic data. Here, we extend these methodological approaches to
decipher the relative contribution and scale-dependent effects of
landscape influences on the transmission of endemic rabies virus in
Serengeti district, Tanzania (area similar to 4,900 km(2)). Utilizing
detailed epidemiological data and 152 complete viral genomes collected
between 2004 and 2013, we show that the localized presence of dogs but
not their density is the most important determinant of diffusion,
implying that culling will be ineffective for rabies control. Rivers and
roads acted as barriers and facilitators to viral spread, respectively,
and vaccination impeded diffusion despite variable annual coverage.
Notably, we found that landscape effects were scale-dependent: rivers
were barriers and roads facilitators on larger scales, whereas the
distribution of dogs was important for rabies dispersal across multiple
scales. This nuanced understanding of the spatial processes that
underpin rabies transmission can be exploited for targeted control at
the scale where it will have the greatest impact. Moreover, this
research demonstrates how current phylogeographic frameworks can be

Here we studied the seed dispersal of the Pacific walnut (Dracontomelon dao), a canopy tree which produces fruit that are common in the diet of the endangered southern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae). We found that gibbons were the most effective disperser for this species; they consumed approximately 45% of the fruit crop, which was four times more than that consumed by macaques - the only other legitimate disperser. Gibbons tracked the temporal (but not spatial) abundance of ripe fruits, indicating this fruit was a preferred species for the gibbon. Both gibbons and macaques dispersed the majority (> 90%) of the seeds at least 20 m away from parent crowns, with mean dispersal distances by gibbons measuring 179.3 +/- 98.0 m (range: 4-425 m). Seeds defecated by gibbons germinated quicker and at greater rates than seeds spat by macaques, or in undispersed fruits. Gibbon-dispersed seeds were also more likely to be removed by unknown seed predators or unknown secondary dispersers. Overall, gibbons play a key role in the regeneration of the Pacific walnut. Our findings have significant implications both for the management of the Pacific walnut tree dominating tropical rainforest as well as the reintroduction program of the Southern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of relatives has profound effects on kin
interactions, inbreeding, and inclusive fitness. Yet, in the marine
environment, the processes that generate patterns of kin structure
remain understudied because larval dispersal on ocean currents was
historically assumed to disrupt kin associations. Recent genetic
evidence of co-occurring siblings challenges this assumption and raises
the intriguing question of how siblings are found together after a
(potentially) disruptive larval phase. Here, we develop individual-based
models to explore how stochastic processes operating at the individual
level affect expected kinship at equilibrium. Specifically, we predict
how limited dispersal, sibling cohesion, and variability in reproductive
success differentially affect patterns of kin structure. All three
mechanisms increase mean kinship within populations, but their spatial
effects are markedly different. We find that (1) when dispersal is
limited, kinship declines monotonically as a function of the distance
between individuals; (2) when siblings disperse cohesively, kinship
increases within a site relative to between sites; and (3) when
reproductive success varies, kinship increases equally at all distances.
The differential effects of these processes therefore only become
apparent when individuals are sampled at multiple spatial scales.
Notably, our models suggest that aggregative larval behaviors, such as
sibling cohesion, are not necessary to explain documented levels of
relatedness within marine populations. Together, these findings
establish a theoretical framework for disentangling the drivers of

abstract = {Aim: To present an updated database of fish species recorded on
south-western Atlantic reef environments and to explore the ecological
drivers of the structure, the latitudinal gradient of biodiversity and
the centre of endemism in this peripheral province.
Location: South-western Atlantic (SWA): Brazilian and Argentinian
Provinces.
Methods: A database composed of 733 fish species along 23 locations in
the SWA (00 degrees 55' N to 43 degrees 00' S) was compiled based on
primary data, literature and museum records. Cluster and beta diversity
analyses were carried out to evaluate faunal overlaps among locations
and subprovinces. ``Target-area-distance effect{''} and ``stepping
stones dispersal{''} hypotheses for assemblage composition were tested
through Mantel tests. Relationships between the distribution patterns
and ecological traits of reef fish species were investigated through
generalized linear mixed-effect models.
Results: Out of the 733 fish species, 405 are SWA resident reef fishes,
of which 111 (27%) are endemics and 78 are threatened with extinction.
Cluster analysis detected six subprovinces in the SWA structured
following the target-area-distance model, and with no evidence for a
latitudinal gradient in diversity. The greatest overall richness and
endemic species richness were found in the east-south-eastern region.
Depth range, habitat use and body size were the main drivers of SWA reef
fish assemblage structure.
Main conclusions: The Brazilian and Argentinian coasts constitute
different provinces structured by oceanographic barriers and
environmental filters. Similarities among oceanic islands indicate
connectivity driven by stochastic and ecological factors. Species
richness and endemism indicate that peripheral provinces may also bear
centres of origin and biodiversity, patterns driven by
parapatric/ecological speciation and the overlap between tropical and
subtropical reef fish species. Ecological drivers of reef fish
distribution, such as habitat specialization and body size, support
hypotheses of speciation in the periphery. New approaches for spatial
planning, marine protected areas and off-reserve marine management are
essential for the conservation and sustainability of SWA reef fishes.},

abstract = {Aim: Is high diversity in tropical and subtropical mountains due to
topographical complexity alone or a combination of topography and
temperature seasonality? Here, we aim to assess the contribution of
these two factors on Rhododendron diversity in China. Specifically, we
evaluate how low temperature seasonality in subtropical China jointly
with heterogeneous environment accounts for increased species diversity
across montane landscapes relative to those of the more seasonal
temperate zone in north China.
Location: China.
Methods: We compiled distributional data for all Rhododendron species in
China and then estimated the species richness patterns of rare versus
common species, and of shrubs versus trees at spatial resolutions of 50
x 50 km. Bivariate regressions were performed to evaluate the effects of
environmental variables on species richness followed by stepwise
regression to select the best set of predictors.
Results: The variables of habitat heterogeneity and climate seasonality
were consistently the strongest predictors of species richness for all
species groups, while the contribution of water and energy variables was
proportionately much lower. Winter coldness had very low predictive
power, which indicated that unlike other woody plants, the northward
dispersal of Rhododendron is not limited by cold winter temperature.
Main conclusions: High Rhododendron diversity in south-west China
appears to be influenced jointly by the climatic gradients induced by
topographical complexity and temperature seasonality as suggested by
Janzen's hypothesis. The increased topographical complexity in
combination with low temperature seasonality in south-west China might
have promoted species accumulation by offering more niche space,
preventing extinction and providing increased opportunities for
allopatric speciation. While our findings strongly indicate the effect
of habitat heterogeneity on species diversity, they also suggest the
role of seasonal uniformity of temperature for increased diversity
towards the tropics. The effect of seasonality may, however, be more
pronounced in plants because of their limited ability to use behaviour
to avoid environmental influences.},

abstract = {Settlement is a complex biological process that, for most species, marks
the end of pelagic larval life and the beginning of benthic life, and is
therefore critical for the replenishment and persistence of marine
benthic populations. Increasing evidence points to the surf zone as an
important last hurdle modulating successful onshore larval settlement in
intertidal and shallow subtidal habitats. Wave hydrodynamics cause the
development of near-bottom flows, which have been suggested as a
mechanism of cross-surf zone transport of heavy sinking competent larvae
of mussels. Here, we tested the generality of this model with new data,
contrasting 2 distant (100 km) sites with different surf zone
configurations and slopes. Daily mussel settlement rates were measured
for 3 periods of 10 d over 3 different settlement seasons between 2015
and 2017, and were related to potential cross-shore transport
mechanisms. When corrected for differences in surf zone slope between
sites and de-seasoned, near-bed bottom flows explained 87% of the
variance in daily settlement at both sites, with the exception of the
steep surf zone site in 2016, when settlement increased even faster with
the flow. When flow direction is considered, site-specific along-shore
and cross-shore transport patterns emerge at the reflective and
dissipative shores, respectively. These patterns suggest that
wave-induced transport through the surf zone can be a general mechanism
favoring onshore mussel settlement, and highlight the importance of
local topography in modulating such transport mechanisms.},

abstract = {1. Recent studies have suggested that spatial patterns of intraspecific
diversity can be influenced by density-dependent processes, which can
inhibit effective migration of new lineages to established populations.
How mechanisms such as dispersal and disturbance influence these
processes is, however, still poorly understood.
2. We hypothesised that (1) species with leptokurtic dispersal (frequent
on small scales but rare on larger scales) would show no spatial
structure on small scales and strong structure on large scales, and (2)
disturbance would influence the chance of genetic turnover in a
population.
3. We tested these hypotheses using empirical genetic (mtDNA) data from
field observations of a model taxon (the buoyant, forest-forming kelp
Durvillaea, which exhibits leptokurtic dispersal distribution), and by
conducting simulation analyses.
4. Our data supported the first hypothesis, with no spatial structure
detected on fine (metres) scales despite evidence of strong structure on
larger (tens to hundreds of kilometres) scales. The second hypothesis
was also supported, with simulations showing that disturbance increased
the rate at which structure developed, and reduced the time to fixation
(monopolisation by a single lineage). The chance of any lineage reaching
fixation was directly related to its initial proportion in the
population, and this relationship was unaffected by changes in
disturbance size or dispersal capacity. We conclude that, in the absence
of selection, extirpation is typically a prerequisite for
population-genetic ``turnover{''}, with remnant (refugial) individuals
otherwise outnumbering immigrants.
5. Synthesis. Disturbance plays a critical role in releasing
density-dependent blocks to colonisation, and thus enables lineage
turnover within species. Our results indicate that although both
disturbance size and dispersal capacity play important roles in the
formation of spatial structure within species, unless a population is
totally extirpated, establishment of genetic lineages from elsewhere
(turnover) is unlikely even for species that can disperse well.},

abstract = {Knowledge of a species' population genetic structure can provide insight into fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes including gene flow, genetic drift and adaptive evolution. Such inference is of particular importance for parasites, as an understanding of their population structure can illuminate epidemiological and coevolutionary dynamics. Here, we describe the population genetic structure of the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, a parasite that infects planktonic crustaceans of the genus Daphnia. This system has become a model for investigations of host-parasite interactions and represents an example of coevolution via negative frequency-dependent selection (aka ``Red Queen{''} dynamics). To sample P. ramosa, we experimentally infected a panel of Daphnia hosts with natural spore banks from the sediments of 25 ponds throughout much of the species range in Europe and western Asia. Using 12 polymorphic variable number tandem repeat loci (VNTR loci), we identified substantial genetic diversity, both within and among localities, that was structured geographically among ponds. Genetic diversity was also structured among host genotypes within ponds, although this pattern varied by locality, with P. ramosa at some localities partitioned into distinct host-specific lineages, and other localities where recombination had shuffled genetic variation among different infection phenotypes. Across the sample range, there was a pattern of isolation by distance, and principal components analysis coupled with Procrustes rotation identified congruence between patterns of genetic variation and geography. Our findings support the hypothesis that Pasteuria is an endemic parasite coevolving closely with its host. These results provide important context for previous studies of this model system and inform hypotheses for future research.},

pollution, heat island effects and providing food and shelter to urban
fauna. Efforts to conserve and augment green cover in cities, however,
often lack data on the genetic diversity of urban trees, which could be
crucial to the success of such programmes. We investigate the population
genetics of the cluster fig Ficus racemosa, which occurs naturally in
Indian cities and is a keystone species for urban fauna. Genetic
analysis of 51 F. racemosa trees in urban Bangalore, India, shows no
evidence of inbreeding; the overall inbreeding coefficient (F (is) )
across 12 microsatellite markers (0.0366) was non-significant with no
evidence of heterozygote deficit. Spatial genetic structure (SGS)
analysis of 47 trees showed an overall negative relationship between
kinship coefficient and spatial distance, with strong SGS at distances <
1 km. The absence of heterozygote deficit is likely due to the fig's
obligate mutualistic association with fig wasps which pollinate their
flowers even across long distances. However, the strong SGS at short
distances could result from clumped seed dispersal close to natal trees.
Therefore, the pattern of population genetics for F. racemosa from urban
Bangalore likely results from short-distance seed dispersal and
long-distance pollen flow. Despite the scattered and fragmented nature
of green areas within cities, these gene mobility factors maintain
robust population genetics in F. racemosa even at low population
densities. The same may not apply for Ficus species that are planted as
vegetative cuttings in cities and therefore may have limited genetic
diversity.},

the spatial and temporal organisation of animals. Territorial fidelity
is often influenced by reproductive success, age, the dispersion and
predictability of resources, and intraspecific competition. We examined
between-year territorial fidelity in wolverines (Gulo gulo), using
location data from 47 individuals collected during 1993-2013 in northern
Sweden, to assess the stability of the spatial organisation of this
solitary carnivore. For females, we also determined residency status
from 1 year to the next. The study population is characterized by a
stable distribution of resident individuals, with both males and females
showing higher fidelity at the total territory level compared to more
intensively used core areas. In 86% of the yearly residency status
estimates (n = 122), the female remained stationary. In the remaining
14% of the cases, females either vacated their territory (8% of
residency statuses), or expanded into a neighbouring territory (6% of
residency statuses). We documented six cases of breeding dispersal,
representing one of the few known cases of breeding dispersal in
longlived large mammals. We suggest that this high territorial fidelity
is enabled by wolverines' caching and scavenging behaviours, which
buffer the unpredictable and large spatiotemporal variation in resource
abundance in this low-productivity area. Breeding dispersal may occur
due to competition for high-quality territories in this saturated
population, where females are forced to abandon their territory by
competitors or bequeath territories to offspring. This study further
highlights the complexity of the social and spatial dynamics for
solitary carnivores.},

habitat loss not habitat fragmentation, whereas the persistence of local
dispersers (i.e. species with clonal reproduction) or mixed dispersers

both habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. Furthermore, habitat

abstract = {Reproduction is intimately linked with dispersal, but the effects of changes in reproductive strategies on dispersal have received little attention. Such changes have occurred in many taxonomic groups, resulting in profound alterations in life-history. In amphibians, many species shifted from oviparous/larviparous aquatic reproduction (deposition of eggs or pre-metamorphic larvae in water) to pueriparous terrestrial reproduction (parturition of terrestrial juveniles). The latter provides greater independence from water by skipping the aquatic larval stage; however, the eco-evolutionary implications of this evolutionary step have been underexplored, largely because reproductive modes rarely vary at the intraspecific level, preventing meaningful comparisons. We studied the effects of a transition to pueriparity on dispersal and fine-scale genetic structure in the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), a species exhibiting two co-occurring reproductive modes: larviparity and pueriparity. We performed genetic analyses (parentage and genetic spatial autocorrelation) using 11 microsatellite loci to compare dispersal and fine-scale genetic structure in three larviparous and three pueriparous populations (354 individuals in total). We did not find significant differences between reproductive modes, but in some larviparous populations movement patterns may be influenced by site-specific features (type of water bodies), possibly due to passive water-borne dispersal of larvae along streams. Additionally, females (especially larviparous ones) appeared to be more philopatric, while males showed greater variation in dispersal distances. This study also points to future avenues of research to better understand the eco-evolutionary implications of changes in reproductive modes in amphibians.},

Although metacommunity structure can be partitioned into spatial and environmental fractions, it remains unclear whether these statistical results can be used to infer the relative importance of dispersal limitation (spatial fraction) and environmental forcing (environmental fraction). Using an environmentally forced, spatially explicit metacommunity model, we show that the distinct effects of the mean (advection) and the standard deviation (diffusion) of the dispersal kernel on biodiversity are not easily detectable via variation partitioning alone. Although increasing dispersal ultimately leads to a decrease in the spatial fraction due to reduced dispersal limitation and greater species sorting, the magnitude of the spatial fraction depends on the complex interplay between the nature of dispersal and the type of boundary conditions in the metacommunity. Indeed, metacommunities characterized by either high or low dispersal can exhibit a small spatial fraction. A case study of a marine metacommunity experiencing strong alongshore transport is consistent with these findings, as the size of the spatial fraction is not associated with dispersal. Overall, our results suggest that accounting for the nature of environmental forcing as well as the multifactorial effects of dispersal is critical for understanding how ecological and environmental processes give rise to biodiversity across spatial scales.},

their population dynamics and used this perturbation to elucidate the
interspecific interactions among fishers, grey foxes (Urocyon

interspecific interactions to investigate the effects members of these

abstract = {Sex- and age-dependence in recruitment and dispersal are often explained by costs arising from competition for holding a breeding territory over the years-a typical feature of species living in stable habitats. For instance, long-lived birds with male territoriality often exhibit large variation in recruitment age and higher dispersal in females and young individuals. As a corollary, we expected that species with ephemeral habitat suitability, and hence nomadic breeding, would show weak age- and sex-dependence in dispersal and low variation in recruitment age, because territory ownership is not maintained over the years. In addition, the higher cost of reproduction in females might not be (over)compensated for by costs of territoriality in males. Accordingly, females would recruit later than males. We explored these variations using multievent capture-recapture models over 13 years, 3479 (2392 sexed) slender-billed gulls (Chroicocephalus genei) and 45 colony sites along the French Mediterranean coast. As expected, variability in recruitment age was low with males recruiting earlier than females. Nonetheless, dispersal in and out of the study area decreased with age and was slightly higher in males than in females. Decreased dispersal with age might result from foraging benefits associated with increased spatial familiarity. Higher dispersal in males might be explained by a male-biased sex ratio or higher philopatry benefits in females (arising from their higher cost of reproduction). Sex- and age-dependent dispersal and recruitment may thus occur in the absence of year-to-year breeding territory ownership, which stresses the importance of considering other processes in shaping recruitment and dispersal patterns.},

opportunities for invaders and reduces the negative impact on native

mechanism on the regional scale if two or more competing species have
different spatial niches, i.e. if the local competitive advantage
changes in space. We consider a more subtle mechanism of space use

densities of two species, diffusing and competing in an infinite
landscape consisting of two types of patches. We include individual
behaviour in terms of movement rate and patch preference. We consider
the scenario that one of the species is the stronger local competitor in
both patch types. We then uncover a number of mechanisms-based solely on
movement behaviour-through which these two species can coexist
regionally, how the inferior competitor can replace the superior
competitor globally, or how a bistable situation can arise between the
two. We calculate mutual invasion conditions as well as mutual spatial
spread rates, and we show that spread rates may depend on movement

distance from the translocation site were always important in fitting
the N-mixture model indicating effects of dispersal and species biology
on estimates of population size. We found that the population is
increasing its range across the island by 5-10% every six months. We
spatially interpolated site-specific abundance from the N-mixture model
to the entire island, and we estimated 1,473 (95% CI, 940-1,802) St.
Croix ground lizards on Buck Island in 2013 corresponding to survey
results. This represents a 26-fold increase since the translocation. We
predicted the future dispersal of the lizards to all habitats on Buck
Island, with the potential for the population to increase by another
five times in the future. Incorporating biologically relevant covariates
as explicit parameters in population models can improve predictions of
population size and the future spread of species introduced to new
localities.},

macroalgal loss, fragmentation and range contractions are eroding
connectivity among populations. Understanding loss, and predicting the
likelihood of recovery, is dependent on knowledge of population
connectivity and how it is mediated by variability in local seascapes.
Although many studies of marine macroalgal connectivity have focussed on
influences of geographic distance on genetic structure, the contribution
of intervening habitat is rarely considered. We tested the extent to
which geographic separation, intervening suitable habitat (reef versus
sand and open water) and local hydrodynamics (inferred from particle
dispersal models) explained structuring of genetic variation at
microsatellite loci in the habitat forming macroalga Lessonia corrugata.
Genetic structuring was best explained by the availability of suitable
intervening habitat (rocky reef) rather than by geographic separation,
although biologically realistic estimates of dispersal probability also
became important at smaller spatial scales. Our results indicate that
ecological separation can be more influential than geographic distance
on population genetic structuring, and this should be considered during
the assessment of connectivity and gene flow in marine species.},

abstract = {Background: The development of satellite tracking technology enables the gathering of huge amounts of accurate data on animal movements over measured time intervals, to reveal essential information about species' patterns of spatial use. This information is especially important in optimizing the design of conservation and management strategies for endangered species. In this study, we analysed the main drivers of daily patterns in the flight activity of the threatened Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus. We studied 19 Bearded Vultures tagged with solar-powered GPS transmitters from 2006 to 2016 in the Pyrenees (Spain). We assessed the relative influence of external factors (season and daylight time) and internal factors (sex, breeding season and territorial status) on their daily activity behaviour by computing mean hourly distance travelled, maximum displacement and cumulative distance travelled per hour. Results: Our findings showed a clear difference in all the estimators between territorial and non-territorial (floating) members of the population, showing that non-territorial individuals spent much longer in flight and travelled larger distances per day. We detected an important influence of daylight time and season on the daily rhythms of Bearded Vultures; flight activity increased during the last three quarters of daylight and was greatest in the spring. Breeding period and sex had also an effect on the maximum displacement and cumulative distance travelled. Individuals flew more during the breeding period and females tended to exhibit greater cumulative and maximum distances per hour than males regardless of breeding season. Conclusions: Pyrenean Bearded Vultures flight daily activity was strongly influenced by daylight time, season, and territorial status, while individual sex and breeding season showed a milder effect on the birds' movement behaviour. This study gives a novel insight into how external factors act as main drivers of the daily flight activity pattern of a long-lived avian scavenger.},

shed light on how they are adapted for their ecosystem. Guyanagaster
necrorhizus is a sequestrate fungus, meaning its dispersal propagules,
or spores, are entirely enclosed within a fruiting body, termed a
sporocarp. This fungus is most closely related to Armillaria and its
allies. While Armillaria species form mushrooms and have forcibly
discharged spores, G. necrorhizus spores have lost this ability, and by
necessity, must be passively dispersed. However, G. necrorhizus does not
possess characteristics of other sequestrate fungi with known dispersal
mechanisms. Repeated observations of termites feeding on G. necrorhizus
sporocarps, and spores subsequently adhering to their exoskeletons, led
to the hypothesis that termites disperse G. necrorhizus spores. To test
this hypothesis, we used microsatellite markers and population genetics
analyses to understand patterns of clonality and population structure of
G. necrorhizus. While Armillaria individuals can spread vegetatively
over large areas, high genotypic diversity in G. necrorhizus populations
suggests spores are the primary mode of dispersal. Spatial genetic
structure analyses show that G. necrorhizus sporocarps within 238 m of
each other are more closely related than would be expected by chance and
conservative estimates from population assignment tests suggest gene
flow no longer occurs between sporocarps separated by 2 km. These
distances are consistent with previous studies analysing foraging
distances of the termites found associated with G. necrorhizus
sporocarps. Termites have rarely been recorded to specifically target
fungal sporocarps, making this a potentially novel fungal-insect

cycad endemic to central Queensland, Australia. Populations of this
species have been impacted by recent infrastructure projects resulting
in translocation of individuals to ameliorate losses. Translocations
require an understanding of the species demographics and intrapopulation

the demography and spatial patterns of a population of C.megacarpa
(approximate to 5600 individuals) within a 96.3ha area in central
Queensland to design a translocation planting that replicates a healthy
population. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the demography
of the population. Spatial Point Pattern Analyses (SPPA) were used to
determine if the population's spatial arrangement departed from complete
spatial randomness across height, gender classes and between female and
juvenile cycads. We found this population to possess a 1:1 ratio of male
and female cycads. However, male C.megacarpa were on average approximate
to 0.5m shorter than female cycads and reached reproductive maturity at
shorter heights. SPPA found this population of C.megacarpa to be
clustered irrespective of height or gender. A significant spatial
relationship was detected between female and juvenile cycads. The
results of this study suggest that to replicate a healthy C.megacarpa

central objective in conservation planning. Evaluating landscape
functional connectivity and mapping habitat networks are key steps for
implementing effective actions, but both remain challenging. Habitat
suitability models (HSM) and spatial graphs provide conservation
managers with useful information for landscape planning. To tackle their
respective drawbacks, we proposed to combine HSM and spatial graphs in a
four-step methodological framework: (i) collect and prepare input data;
(ii) model habitat suitability using MaxEnt to map the species' habitat
suitability index (HSI); (iii) transform the HSI map into spatial graph
inputs using GIS; and, (iv) perform spatial graph connectivity analysis
using Graphab. The outputs of this species-specific and quantitative
approach were maps of the species' habitat network. Habitat patches and
dispersal linkages were ranked according to their importance for overall
habitat availability and landscape connectivity. This prioritization
identified locations where conservation biologists and landscape
planners should focus conservation and restoration efforts. This
framework is illustrated here with a case study on the woodlark (Lullula

shifting niches of multiple interacting organisms. Such interactions are
especially complex in tropical ecosystems, including endangered peat
forests of Central Borneo, a biodiversity hot spot and home to the
critically endangered orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii). We combined
studies of the digestive physiology of captive orangutans in Australia
with detailed field studies of wild orangutans in the Natural Laboratory
of Peat-Swamp Forest of Sabangau, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. By
measuring the gut transit time (TT) of indigestible seed mimics (beads)
in captivity and applying this as a temporal constraint to movement data
of wild orangutans, we developed a mechanistic, time-explicit spatial
model to project the seed dispersal patterns by these large-bodied,
arboreal frugivores. We followed seven orangutans and established home
range kernels using Time Local Convex Hull (T-LoCoH) modelling. This
allowed us to model individual orangutan movements and to adjust these
models according to gut transit times to estimate seed dispersal
kernels. Female movements were conservative (core ranges of 55 and 52 ha
in the wet and dry seasons, respectively) and revisitation rates to the
same location of n = 4 in each 24-h block. Male movements were more
unpredictable, yielding fragmented core ranges and revisitation rates to
the same location of only 1.2 times each 24 h; males also demonstrated
large disjunctions where they moved rapidly over long distances and were
frequently lost from view. Seed dispersal kernels were nested
predictably within the core ranges of females, but not males. We used
the T-LoCoH approach to analyse movement ecology, which offered a
powerful tool to predict the primary deposition of seeds by orangutans,
thereby providing a reliable method for making a priori predictions of
seed dispersal dynamics by other frugivores in novel ecosystems.},

To assess the role of species traits related to dispersal capacities in diatom biogeography. Location Rivers and streams of Sweden sampled over a total area of 450,000km(2). MethodsWe used partial redundancy analyses and variation partitioning coupled with spatial eigenfunctions analyses to separate the effects of environment and space at three different scales on diatoms community structure. As community analyses might give limited insight into species-specific mechanisms, we also performed species by species variation partitioning and the amount of variance explained by each fraction was related to species cell length and attachment to the substrate. Results We found a strong effect of environment and space at a large scale suggesting environmental filtering and dispersal limitation over large distances. Additionally, species-based analyses uncovered an effect of space at fine scale suggesting possible species-specific mass effect dynamic or species sorting driven by missing environmental factors varying at fine scale. Environmental and spatial effects varied strongly among species, but this variation was not explained by cell length and attachment to the substrate. Main conclusions Our results confirm the importance of both environment and dispersal-related processes in controlling diatom community structure and bring new perspectives on the role of dispersal in shaping microbial communities at biogeographical scale. Dispersal being a species-specific mechanism, species associations are not necessarily conserved from site to site and species-based approaches can detect different spatial patterns than those derived from traditional community analyses. Contrary to the conclusions of small-scale analysis of connected metacommunities, interspecific trait variation seems to be of limited importance for long-distance overland dispersal in diatoms.},

natural communities and ecosystem worldwide. An understanding of the
eco-evolutionary processes underlying fragmentation-compromised
communities in natural settings is lacking, yet critical to realistic
and sustainable conservation. Through integrating the multivariate
genetic, biotic and abiotic facets of a natural community module
experiencing various degrees of habitat fragmentation, we provide unique
insights into the processes underlying community functioning in real,
natural conditions. The focal community module comprises a parasitic
butterfly of conservation concern and its two obligatory host species, a
plant and an ant. We show that both historical dispersal and ongoing
habitat fragmentation shape population genetic diversity of the
butterfly Phengaris alcon and its most limited host species (the plant
Gentiana pneumonanthe). Genetic structure of each species was strongly
driven by geographical structure, altitude and landscape connectivity.
Strikingly, however, was the strong degree of genetic costructure among
the three species that could not be explained by the spatial variables
under study. This finding suggests that factors other than spatial
configuration, including co-evolutionary dynamics and shared dispersal
pathways, cause parallel genetic structure among interacting species.
While the exact contribution of co-evolution and shared dispersal routes
on the genetic variation within and among communities deserves further
attention, our findings demonstrate a considerable degree of genetic
parallelism in natural meta-communities. The significant effect of
landscape connectivity on the genetic diversity and structure of the
butterfly also suggests that habitat fragmentation may threaten the
functioning of the community module on the long run.},

Understanding movement through seed dispersal in the marine environment can be difficult due to the high spatial and temporal variability of ocean currents. We employed a mutually enriching approach of population genetic assignment procedures and dispersal predictions from a hydrodynamic model to overcome this difficulty and quantify the movement of dispersing floating fruit of the temperate seagrass Posidonia australis Hook.f. across coastal waters in south-western Australia. Dispersing fruit cohorts were collected from the water surface over two consecutive years, and seeds were genotyped using microsatellite DNA markers. Likelihood-based genetic assignment tests were used to infer the meadow of origin for seed cohorts and individuals. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was coupled with a particle transport model to simulate the movement of fruit at the water surface. Floating fruit cohorts were mainly assigned genetically to the nearest meadow, but significant genetic differentiation between cohort and most likely meadow of origin suggested a mixed origin. This was confirmed by genetic assignment of individual seeds from the same cohort to multiple meadows. The hydrodynamic model predicted 60% of fruit dispersed within 20 km, but that fruit was physically capable of dispersing beyond the study region. Concordance between these two independent measures of dispersal provides insight into the role of physical transport for long distance dispersal of fruit and the consequences for spatial genetic structuring of seagrass meadows.},

abstract = {Aim: Despite their often high-trophic position and their contribution to
many ecosystem functions, little is known about the factors affecting
assemblage structure of medium- and large-sized neotropical vertebrates.
We examined the relative roles played by the physical and biological
environment, and by purely spatial processes, in shaping the composition
and diversities of these vertebrate assemblages. Then, based on the
theory that the Guianan forest cover shrank to isolated pockets during
the late Pleistocene-Holocene, we tested if the past forest refugia may
have shaped current vertebrate assemblages.
Location: French Guiana, Guiana Shield, South America.
Methods: Abundances of 19 medium- and large-sized vertebrates were
estimated at 21 locations in undisturbed Guianan rain forests. Using
taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic metrics, we partitioned the
effects of a range of physical and biological environmental conditions
and purely spatial predictors in shaping both assemblage composition and
(alpha and beta) diversities.
Results: We identified a significant, but weak relationship between
taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic assemblage composition and
environmental conditions. Assemblage diversity patterns were mainly
explained by spatial predictors irrespective of the metrics. Current
assemblage diversities are correlated with Pleistocene-Holocene forest
history, with the highest alpha diversities outside of putative forest
refugia, and the highest beta diversities inside these areas.
Main conclusions: Current vertebrate assemblage composition is not
strongly marked by common environmental factors. Our main conclusion is
that assemblage composition results from individual species responses to
the environment. Our findings also suggest that dispersal-related
processes or more probably historical processes shape (alpha and beta)
diversity patterns. In fact, forest fragmentation during
Pleistocene-Holocene climate changes could have led to isolated
vertebrate assemblages evolving into unique species assemblages creating
the current high beta diversity inside refugia, whereas the lower
habitat stability outside of refugia could have led to mixed assemblages
in areas recolonized by forest vertebrates (current high alpha diversity
outside of refugia).},

interfluvia, rarely within them, where geographic variability in
morphological traits might be observed. We tested for intraspecific
phenotypic variation in three bird species within the Purus-Madeira
interfluvium (Central Amazon) and whether phenotypes were correlated
with environmental heterogeneity or geographic distance among sites. We
compared coloration indexes derived from reflectance spectra and
morphometrics of up to five adult individuals of each sex among 11 sites
within the interfluvium and contrasted them with proxies for geographic
distance and environmental variation (tree basal area and bird
community). Environmental heterogeneity was minimally spatially
autocorrelated, and there were no obvious geographical barriers to
dispersal in the study region. The null hypothesis was that we would see
either no phenotypic variation or random variation that was not
explained by the tested variables. Half of the cases analyzed showed
intraspecific morphological variation. Coloration varied more frequently
than morphometrics, and color was better explained by environmental
heterogeneity, particularly in males, whereas brightness also varied
with geographic distance. Geographic distance explained the only case of
variation in morphometrics. Our results indicate that coloration,
particularly plumage brightness, is more labile than morphometric traits
and that plumage color might be under stronger effects of local
adaptation than brightness, which also seems to be under effects of
neutral drift and gene flow among populations. Higher frequencies of
association between male coloration and the environment suggest a role
of non-arbitrary mechanisms of sexual selection on the expression of
male phenotypes, whereas arbitrary intersexual selection might explain
the randomly distributed variation that is not explained by
environmental heterogeneity or geographic distance. We revealed
intraspecific phenotypic variation in a spatial extent usually not
considered in biogeographic studies in the Amazon and demonstrate that
both local adaptation and neutral drift are important to explain
intraspecific trait diversification at this geographical scale.},

abstract = {1. The rate at which a population grows and spreads can depend on
individual behaviour and interactions with others. In many species with
two sexes, males and females differ in key life-history traits (e.g.
growth, survival and dispersal), which can scale up to affect population
rates of growth and spread. In sexually reproducing species, the
mechanics of locating mates and reproducing successfully introduce
further complications for predicting the invasion speed (spread rate),
as both can change nonlinearly with density.
2. Most models of population spread are based on one sex, or include
limited aspects of sex differences. Here we ask whether and how the
dynamics of finding mates interact with sex-specific life-history traits
to influence the rate of population spread.
3. We present a hybrid approach for modelling invasions of populations
with two sexes that links individual-level mating behaviour (in an
individual-based model) to population-level dynamics (in an
integrodifference equationmodel).
4. We find that limiting the amount of time during which individuals can
search for mates causes a demographic Allee effect which can slow,
delay, or even prevent an invasion. Furthermore, any sex-based
asymmetries in life history or behaviour (skewed sex ratio, sex-biased
dispersal, and sex-specific mating behaviours) amplify these effects. In
contrast, allowing individuals to mate more than once ameliorates these
effects, enabling polygynandrous populations to invade under conditions
where monogamously mating populations would fail to establish.
5. We show that details of individuals' mating behaviour can impact the
rate of population spread. Based on our results, we propose a stricter
definition of a mate-finding Allee effect, which is not met by the
commonly used minimum mating function. Our modelling approach, which
links individual- and population-level dynamics in a single model, may
be useful for exploring other aspects of individual behaviour that are
thought to impact the rate of population spread.},

IFD. We place a simple model of discrete patch choice under limits to

population growth driven by that underlying quality. Our model follows
the population's distribution through both breeding and dispersal
seasons when perception limits differ in their likely influence. We
demonstrate that populations of perception limited movers can
approximate an IFD provided sufficient population growth; however, the
emergent IFD would be temporally inconstant and correspond to
reproductive events. The time to emergence of the IFD during breeding is
shorter under exponential growth than under logistic growth. The IFD
during early colonization of a community persists longer when more
patches are available to individuals. As the population matures and
dispersal becomes increasingly random, there is an oscillation in the
observance of IFD, with peaks most closely approximating the IFD
occurring immediately after reproductive events, and higher reproductive
rates producing distributions closer to the IFD.},

However, researchers have often assumed that interdependent effects are independently related to animals' responses, underestimating the importance of one or several landscape processes in driving species declines. 2. We demonstrate how to disentangle the interdependent effects of habitat amount, fragmentation, and edge context on population size by assessing abundance of a rapidly declining grassland songbird species (grasshopper sparrow Ammodramus savannarum) in eastern Kansas (USA). We conducted >7,000 point count surveys at >2,000 sites over two breeding seasons, then modelled the direct, interactive, and indirect effects of landscape factors on abundance within spatial scales (200-, 400-, 800-, and 1,600-m radii) relevant to our focal species' dispersal behaviour. 3. Sparrow abundance correlated most strongly with landscape structure within 400-m radii, increasing nonlinearly with grassland area and decreasing with the proportion of grassland near cropland or woody edges. Sparrows' negative response to cropland edges was mostly an added, indirect consequence of reduced grassland area, whereas sparrows' stronger negative response to woody edges was not attributable to variation in grassland area.

abstract = {Livestock depredation was a primary factor in wolf extirpation from most
of the conterminous United States by the 1930s. Through reintroductions
and natural dispersals, gray wolves (Canis lupus) have recolonized
portions of their former range. Livestock grazing occurs on federal
lands in the western United States, including 31% of wolf-occupied
areas in Idaho, Montana, and Washington. We investigated characteristics
of cattle (Bos taurus) grazing allotments (n = 70) in Idaho (2004-2008),
Montana (1991-2008), and Washington (2008-2016) to predict cattle
depredation risk on grazing allotments in current and probable
wolf-occupied areas of Washington (n = 162). Depredation probability and
the predicted number of cattle depredated increased for allotments with
higher cattle and wolf abundance. Top models accurately predicted 38%
(n = 8) of allotments with verified cattle depredations as >= 61%
depredation probability. Assuming pack sizes of five or ten wolves, 10%
(n = 16) and 15% (n = 24) of cattle grazing allotments in Washington
were forecasted at >= 61% depredation probability, respectively. This
preliminary study identified areas in which wildlife and rangeland
management agencies can focus proactive depredation prevention measures.
However, additional fine-scale data (e.g., GPS locations of depredation
locations and wolf core areas, animal husbandry practices, actual number
of cattle by age class) are needed to improve model performance and
further evaluate cattle depredation risk by wolves on grazing allotments

abstract = {Many field studies on plant seed dispersal teach us that we cannot judge the effective dispersal mode of plants by examining only the morphologies of the fruits and seeds. In the present study, we explored the seed dispersal process of an evergreen tree, the Japanese star anise Illicium anisatum, which is highly toxic, containing neurotoxins in both the fruits and seeds. The fruits exhibit ballochory, a mode of seed dispersal characterized by explosive fruit dehiscence, and the extreme toxicity apparently seems to deter fruit and seed consumption by animals. However, we found that the dispersal distance afforded by this mode was very short (ae<currency> 6 m). In the field, we confirmed that a passerine species, the varied tit Poecile varius, was the only consumer of the seed in foliage, and the bird actively transported seeds or fruits to either cache or consume them. Seeds setting on the forest understory were removed by the small Japanese field mouse Apodemus argenteus, and were also dispersed by this animal. Analysis of seedling spatial distribution revealed that seedlings were highly aggregated near standing trees or fallen logs, suggesting that caching facilitated seed dispersal. This study warns that plant toxicity and the ecological function thereof should not be evaluated based only on limited knowledge of the effects on humans and mammals. Our results pose further questions on the evolution of toxin tolerance in seed-caching animals and on the mutualism between toxic plants and animals.},

abstract = {Aim: Correlative distribution models have been used to identify
potential climatic controls of mangrove range limits, but there is still
uncertainty about the relative importance of these factors across
different regions. To provide insights into the strength of climatic
control of different mangrove range limits, we tested whether temporal
variability in mangrove abundance increases near range limits and
whether this variability is correlated with climatic factors thought to
control large-scale mangrove distributions.
Location: North and South America.
Time period: 1984-2011.
Major taxa studied: Avicennia germinans, Avicennia schuaeriana,
Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa.
Methods: We characterized temporal variability in the enhanced
vegetation index (EVI) at mangrove range limits using Landsat satellite
imagery collected between 1984-2011. We characterized greening trends at
each range limit, examined variability in EVI along latitudinal
gradients near each range limit, and assessed correlations between
changes in EVI and temperature and precipitation.
Results: Spatial variability in mean EVI was generally correlated with
temperature and precipitation, but the relationships were region
specific. Greening trends were most pronounced at range limits in
eastern North America. In these regions variability in EVI increased
toward the range limit and was sensitive to climatic factors. In
contrast, EVI at range limits on the Pacific coast of North America and
both coasts of South America was relatively stable and less sensitive to
climatic variability.
Main conclusions: Our results suggest that range limits in eastern North
America are strongly controlled by climate factors. Mangrove expansion
in response to future warming is expected to be rapid in regions that
are highly sensitive to climate variability (e.g. eastern North
America), but the response in other range limits (e.g. South America) is
likely to be more complex and modulated by additional factors such as
dispersal limitation, habitat constraints, and/or changing climatic
means rather than just extremes.},

abstract = {Many wildlife populations are either naturally, or as a result of human
land use, patchily distributed in space. The degree of
fragmentation-specifically the remaining patch sizes and habitat
configuration-is an important part of population dynamics. Demographic
stochasticity is also likely to play an important role in patchy
habitats that host small local populations. We develop a simulation
model to evaluate the significance of demographic stochasticity and the
role fragmentation plays in the determination of population dynamics and
the risk of extinction of populations on habitat patches. Our model is
formulated as a Markov-chain stochastic process on a finite, spatially
explicit array of patches in which probability of successful dispersal
is a function of interpatch distance. Unlike past work, we explicitly
model local population dynamics and examine how these scale up to the
entire population. As a test case, we apply the model to the American
pika (Ochotona princeps) population living on the ore dumps in the ghost
mining town of Bodie, California. This population has been studied
nearly continuously for over four decades and has been of conservation
concern as the southern half of the population declined precipitously
beginning in 1989. Our model suggests that both the specific
configuration of habitat and landscape heterogeneity are necessary and
sufficient predictors of the eventual extinction of the southern
constellation of patches. This example has important implications, as it
suggests that fragmentation alone can lead to regional extinctions
within metapopulations.},

abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental component of the life history of most
species. Dispersal influences fitness, population dynamics, gene flow,
genetic drift and population genetic structure. Even small differences
in dispersal can alter ecological interactions and trigger an
evolutionary cascade. Linking such ecological processes with
evolutionary patterns is difficult, but can be carried out in the proper
comparative context. Here, we investigate how differences in phoretic
dispersal influence the population genetic structure of two different
parasites of the same host species. We focus on two species of
host-specific feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) that co-occur on
feral rock pigeons (Columba livia). Although these lice are ecologically
very similar, ``wing lice{''} (Columbicola columbae) disperse
phoretically by ``hitchhiking{''} on pigeon flies (Diptera:
Hippoboscidae), while ``body lice{''} (Campanulotes compar) do not.
Differences in the phoretic dispersal of these species are thought to
underlie observed differences in host specificity, as well as the degree
of host-parasite cospeciation. These ecological and macroevolutionary
patterns suggest that body lice should exhibit more genetic
differentiation than wing lice. We tested this prediction among lice on
individual birds and among lice on birds from three pigeon flocks. We
found higher levels of genetic differentiation in body lice compared to
wing lice at two spatial scales. Our results indicate that differences
in phoretic dispersal can explain microevolutionary differences in
population genetic structure and are consistent with macroevolutionary
differences in the degree of host-parasite cospeciation.},

biological communities, there remain tremendous technical challenges for
investigating influence of environmental stressors (e.g., chemical
pollution) on biological communities. High-throughput sequencing-based
metabarcoding provides a powerful tool to reveal complex interactions
between environments and biological communities. Among many technical
issues, the clustering strategies for operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
which are crucial for assessing biodiversity of communities, may affect
final conclusions. Here, we used zooplankton communities along an
environmental pollution gradient in the Chaobai River in Northern China
to test different clustering strategies, including nonclustering and
clustering with varied thresholds. Our results showed that though the
number of OTUs estimated by nonclustering strategies and clustering
strategies with divergence thresholds of 99%-97% largely varied, they
were able to identify the same set of significant environmental and
spatial variables responsible for geographical distributions of
zooplankton communities. In addition, the ecological conclusions
obtained by clustering thresholds of 99%-97% were consistent with
nonclustering strategies, where for all eight clustering scenarios we
detected that species sorting predicted by environmental variables
overrode dispersal as the dominant factor in structuring zooplankton
communities. However, clustering with the divergence thresholds of <95%
affected the environmental and spatial variables identified. We conclude
that both newly developed nonclustering methods and traditional
clustering methods with divergence thresholds >= 97% were reliable to
reveal mechanisms of complex community-environment interactions,
although different clustering strategies could lead to largely varied
biodiversity estimates such as those for alpha-diversity.},

abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation often reduce gene flow and genetic
diversity in plants by disrupting the movement of pollen and seed.
However, direct comparisons of the contributions of pollen vs. seed
dispersal to genetic variation in fragmented landscapes are lacking. To
address this knowledge gap, we partitioned the genetic diversity
contributed by male gametes from pollen sources and female gametes from
seed sources within established seedlings of the palm Oenocarpus bataua
in forest fragments and continuous forest in northwest Ecuador. This
approach allowed us to quantify the separate contributions of each of
these two dispersal processes to genetic variation. Compared to
continuous forest, fragments had stronger spatial genetic structure,
especially among female gametes, and reduced effective population sizes.
We found that within and among fragments, allelic diversity was lower
and genetic structure higher for female gametes than for male gametes.
Moreover, female gametic allelic diversity in fragments decreased with
decreasing surrounding forest cover, while male gametic allelic
diversity did not. These results indicate that limited seed dispersal
within and among fragments restricts genetic diversity and strengthens
genetic structure in this system. Although pollen movement may also be
impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, it nonetheless serves to
promote gene flow and diversity within and among fragments. Pollen and
seed dispersal play distinctive roles in determining patterns of genetic
variation in fragmented landscapes, and maintaining the integrity of
both dispersal processes will be critical to managing and conserving
genetic variation in the face of continuing habitat loss and
fragmentation in tropical landscapes.},

abstract = {Context Mountainous landscapes are characterized by strong spatial
heterogeneity, leading to increasing geographical isolation and
decreasing area with elevation. Consequently, the colonization rate
decreases from the low to high elevation zone, while the extinction rate
shows the opposite.
Objectives Due to such changes, we test whether (1) species occur at a
declining number of sites (mountains) and have a less positive
abundance-occupancy relationship (AOR) in a higher elevation zone; (2) a
lower proportion of rare large-bodied species (less resistant to
extinction) and a more positive abundance-body mass relationship (ABR)
emerge in a higher elevation zone.
Methods Using the data of small mammals from 20 elevational gradients in
the Mountainous Region of Southwest China, we compared the AORs and ABRs
among the low, middle and high elevation zones. The AOR and ABR were
fitted with linear and polynomial regression models. We compared endemic
ratios among the different elevation zones.
Results The AOR was best characterized by a linear model and positive in
all elevation zones. Its slope decreased from the low to high elevation
zone. The quadratic model performed the best in fitting the ABR in each
zone. When fitted with linear models, both the R-2 and slope of the ABR
increased towards the high elevation zone. The endemic ratios were
significantly higher in the middle and high elevation zones.
Conclusions Both the AOR and ABR in mountainous landscapes are strongly
elevation-dependent. The increasing geographical isolation and
decreasing area with elevation can have a high impact on macroecological

invasive species are frequently poorly known. This makes the development
of effective strategies problematic. Spatially explicit population
models, offering a virtual platform to test the implications of life
history hypotheses or alternative management strategies can therefore
provide valuable and inexpensive support on which to base management

abstract = {The selection of reserves for biodiversity conservation involves the
evaluation of multiple criteria, ranging from representativeness of
ecological features to anthropogenic interests and spatial
configuration. Among the principal spatial attributes to be considered,
connectivity has received particular emphasis in response to the
escalating threat of habitat loss and fragmentation. Connectivity is an
intrinsic property of networks. Consequently, we have observed the
gradual development of the concept of reserve networks, enlisting also
tools from the mathematical branch of network theory. Here, we first
outline three key aspects of reserve selection for connectivity
conservation based on network analysis. 1) It may be based on the
application of topological indices, which take into consideration only
the geographical position of the habitat patches, or area-weighted
indices, which add a premium to larger patches. 2) It may be done
through single-node analysis, where the relative importance of patches
is evaluated individually, or with the more efficient multi-node
analysis, where we search for the optimal group of patches that best
complement each other in the role of maintaining connectivity. 3) The
goal of the selection may be to avoid fragmentation of the population
into isolated portions, or to ensure that reachability is maintained to
all habitat patches, including peripheral sites. In previous studies, we
had introduced multi-node analysis to the prioritization of reserves,
using fragmentation and reachability indices, but these were limited to
topology only. Here, we present an improved approach where multi-node
prioritization is performed with area-weighted fragmentation. We apply
it to 20 bird species in Catalonia, Spain. In comparison with
single-node and/or topological fragmentation, we observed here a
decentralization of the selected reserve sets: they included not only
the main core population, but also secondary clusters of well-connected
habitat. This may potentially bring two added advantages to the reserve
network: spreading of risk, and inclusion of a wider variety of local
genetic profiles. We propose combining this approach with topological
reachability, to account for peripheral populations and maximize
accessibility to the entire network.},

abstract = {Aim: Large-scale diversity patterns are generated by different but not
mutually exclusive mechanisms. However, understanding of multiple facets
of diversity and their determinants in the freshwater realm remains
limited. Here, we characterized the geographical gradients, hotspots and
spatial congruence of three facets of freshwater molluscan diversity and
evaluated the relative importance of three different underlying
mechanisms related to the energy, area/environmental heterogeneity and
dispersal/historical hypotheses.
Location: China.
Methods: Species richness (SR), functional richness (FR) and taxonomic
distinctness (TD, a proxy of phylogenetic diversity) were calculated for
212 drainage basins with a total of 313 molluscan species. Spatial
congruence between the diversity facets was evaluated with Pearson
correlation coefficient and overlap among hotspots. Multiple linear
regression models and variation partitioning were used to assess the
relative importance of different mechanisms.
Results: Hotspots of SR and FR were mainly concentrated in the Yangtze
River and Huai River basins, while high TD values were patchily
distributed across China. We found extremely low spatial congruence
between TD and both SR and FR, while there was relatively high
concordance between SR and FR. All diversity facets were best explained
by the dispersal/historical hypothesis with strong unique effects,
followed by the factors related to the energy hypothesis. The
area/environmental heterogeneity hypothesis was only weakly supported.
Main conclusions: We found a potentially strong influence of dispersal
limitation and evolutionary history on the geographical diversity
gradients of Chinese molluscs. This finding contrasts with the general
finding that energy-related factors are the strongest correlates of
diversity patterns at large spatial scales. Moreover, our results do not
support the idea that using any one diversity component as a surrogate
of the others in developing conservation strategies. Instead, an
integrative approach embracing multiple facets of diversity should be
adopted in the conservation of freshwater biodiversity.},

that harvesting reduces the population synchrony scale if it depends
more strongly on population fluctuations than the density dependence of
the growth rate in the absence of harvesting. We show that constant and
proportional harvesting always increases the spatial scale, using a
theta-logistic model for density regulation. We also provide exact
scaling results under harvesting for the Beverton-Holt and the Ricker
stock-recruitment models that are commonly applied, e.g. in fisheries.
Our results indicate that harvest in areas with large abundances should
be encouraged to avoid increase of the spatial scale of synchrony in the
population fluctuations that can lead to unexpected quasi-extinction of
populations over large areas. Our results quantify this harvesting
impact giving the resulting scales of spatial synchrony of population
fluctuations. This emphasizes the importance of estimating the form of
density dependence as well as the dependency of harvest upon population
density of exploited populations, in order to get reliable predictions
of the size of areas that can undergo simultaneous quasi-extinction. (C)

abstract = {Aim: It is commonly asserted that climate presents the primary
constraint on species' geographic distributions, and that species'
distributions should therefore shift to track changing climate. However,
the evidence is surprisingly mixed about the causal link between
species' distributions and climate. Correlations between distributions
and climate may be indirect, reflecting influences of other spatially
structured habitat variables (e.g., land cover) and/or population
processes (e.g., dispersal). Here, we ask if species' geographic
distributions are more strongly related to climate, or to other
spatially structured variables.
Location: The contiguous United States and southern Canada.
Time period: 1990-2000.
Major taxa studied: North American passerine birds.
Methods: We used the breeding-season distributions of 19 widespread
species of passerine birds whose breeding-season distributions fall
entirely within the area sampled by the North American Breeding Bird
Survey. We related these distributions to temperature and precipitation,
geographic coordinates, and the degree of occupation of neighboring
sites by conspecifics. Two spatial scales were examined: the geographic
location of species' ranges within North America, and site occupancy
within species' ranges. We examine these relationships using generalized
linear models, structural equation modeling, random forest models and
spatial correlograms.
Results: On average, geographic coordinates and a model of neighborhood
occupancy outperform a simple climatic model. After controlling for
geographic coordinates, species occupancy is poorly related to climate.
Neighborhood occupancy accounts for the majority of variance captured by
geographic coordinates within ranges, and more for the continental
placement of ranges. On average, species' distributions are more
strongly and more directly related to spatial coordinates, and
neighborhood occupancy, than to climate.
Main conclusions: Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that
climate is the primary, direct determinant of species' geographic
distributions. Rather, other spatially structured factors appear to be
stronger determinants of both continental range placement and
within-range distributions of this sample of North American birds.},

The aim was to determine its probable current range and to evaluate the probability of its dispersal to neighboring countries within the next 5years. LocationMethodsCities and transport hubs of European Russia and neighboring countries. Ash trees in this region occur mainly in urban plantations and along highways. Pairwise distances between all locations were used as the main parameter determining the probability of pest spread. For each location, the probability of detection of A.planipennis was calculated using three simulation recurrent models of long-distance dispersal. Parametrization was made by comparison with results of surveys in 2003-2015. Field data on the range of A.planipennis in 2016-2017 were mapped and used for model verification. A prognosis of spread of the pest by 2022 was made. ResultsMain conclusionsA model based on fat-tailed kernel corresponds to both negative and positive results of surveys. According to the model, the current range is likely to be restricted to Russia, but probability of detection of the pest in the east of Belarus, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania by 2022 is 15%-40%. The forestry services of neighboring countries probably have about 5years to prepare for the invasion of this pest, but regular surveys are necessary, since the pest can appear at any time.

abstract = {Natal dispersal, the one-way movement between birth site and first
breeding site, is an important determinant of species gene-flow and
invasion potential. While dispersing in unfamiliar habitat, individuals
may adjust their movement based on possible costs and benefits of
moving, termed context-dependent dispersal. The role of factors, such as
population density or spatial organisation of habitats, is well studied
in the departure, transfer and settlement phases of dispersal. However,
the role of predators for context-dependent dispersal remains less
studied, particularly for the transfer phase and settlement phase of
natal dispersal. We studied natal dispersal of radio-collared Eurasian
red squirrels, Sciurus vulgaris, in relation to nest site locations of
their main predator, the goshawk, Accipiter gentilis, in Finland. The
locations of nest sites of goshawk had no influence on movement made
during the transfer phase or on the location of settlement sites of
juvenile red squirrels. Limited data on squirrel response to indices of
predator presence (call playback of goshawk and faecal odours of
mammalian predators) appeared to support the conclusion that predators
had limited role in explaining movements of dispersers. We suggest that
predators do not modify context-dependent dispersal among red squirrels
in our boreal study area. This finding may be due to the low density of
squirrel predators in northern boreal forests but may not hold true for
species in which dispersers frequently encounter predators. Our study
supports the conclusion that the resource and habitat availability are
more important factors than predator presence for context-dependent
dispersal among red squirrels.},

abstract = {Measuring contemporary dispersal in highly mobile terrestrial species is
challenging, especially when species are characterized by low levels of
population differentiation. Directly transmitted viruses can be used as
a surrogate for traditional methods of tracking host movement. Feline
immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a species-specific lentivirus, which has
an exceptionally high mutation rate and circulates naturally in wild
felids. Using samples derived from 35 lion (Panthera leo) prides, we
tested the prediction that FIV in lions (FIVPle) can be used to track
the dispersal of individuals between prides. As FIVPle subtypes are
geographically structured throughout Africa, we predicted that this
marker could be used to detect phylogeographic structure of lions at
smaller spatial scales. Phylogenetic analyses of FIV(Ple)pol-RT
sequences showed that core pride members (females and subadults) shared
evolutionary close viral lineages which differed from neighbouring core
prides, whereas sequences from sexually mature males associated with the
same pride were always the most divergent. In six instances, natal pride
associations of divergent male lions could be inferred, on the
assumption that FIVPle infections are acquired during early life stages.
Congruence between the genetic pattern of FIV and pride structure
suggests that vertical transmission plays an important role in lion FIV
dynamics. At a fine spatial scale, significant viral geographic
structuring was also detected between lions occurring north of the
Olifants River within the Kruger National Park (KNP) and those occupying
the southern and central regions. This pattern was further supported by
phylogenetic analyses and the confinement of FIVPle subtype E to the
northern region of KNP. The study provides new insights into the use of
retroviral sequences to predict host dispersal and fine-scale
contemporary geographic structure in a social felid species.},

abstract = {The decay of assemblage similarity with spatial distance can be explained by alternative mechanisms: dispersal limitation and species sorting. To understand their relative contributions, we compare the decay in faunal similarity with spatial distance and, independently, with climatic distance, of 21 beetle taxa with varying dispersal abilities and ecological niches, in southern and northern Europe. Similarity in beetle faunas was associated to spatial but not to climatic distances, pointing to the preponderance of dispersal processes rather than niche constraints. In most taxa, southern faunas were more dissimilar than northern ones: smaller initial similarity and steeper distance decay rate. Distance decay patterns in the north were relatively flat and very similar across taxa, suggesting that only good dispersers would have reached those latitudes after the glacial retreat. The difference in distance decay patterns between north and south is correlated with the taxon's slope of the distance decay pattern in the south and with its latitudinal richness difference. That is, in taxa with distance decay patterns similarly flat in the south and the north, the latitudinal richness gradient is weak. This correlation points again to differences in dispersal ability as a major determinant of biogeographic patterns in European beetles. Both dispersal and niche-related characteristics explained north-south slope differences, but dispersal attributes turned out to be more relevant when initial similarity and distance decay strength were considered together. Our results show that, to understand diversity patterns in Europe, closely related biological groups cannot be assumed to be surrogates and regions with different historical biogeography should be analysed separately. Paradoxically, the study of beetle faunas of southern Europe will shed light on the processes controlling the recolonization of northern latitudes.},

abstract = {ContextThe Rainwater Basin region in south-central Nebraska supports a complex network of spatially-isolated wetlands that harbor diverse floral and faunal communities. Since European settlement, many wetlands have been lost from the network, which has increased distances among remaining wetlands. As a result, populations of wildlife species with limited dispersal capabilities may have become isolated and face greater local extinction risks.ObjectivesWe compared the pre-European settlement and current extent of the Rainwater Basin network to assess the effects of wetland losses on network connectivity for a range of maximum dispersal distances. MethodsWe constructed network models for a range of maximum dispersal distances and calculated network metrics to assess changes in network connectivity and the relative importance of individual wetlands in regulating flow.ResultsSince European settlement, the number of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin has decreased by>90%. The average distance to the nearest neighboring wetland has increased by 150% to similar to 1.2km, and the dispersal distance necessary to travel throughout the whole network has increased from 3.5 to 10.0km. Last, relative importance of individual wetlands depended on the maximum dispersal distance. Which wetlands to preserve to maintain connectivity might therefore depend on the dispersal capabilities of the species or taxa of interest.ConclusionsTo preserve a broad range of biodiversity, conservation efforts should focus on preserving dense clusters of wetlands at fine spatial scales to maintain current levels of network connectivity, and restoring connections between clusters to facilitate long-range dispersal of species with limited dispersal capabilities.},

abstract = {Managing and restoring faunal diversity across large areas requires an
understanding of the roles of connectivity and dispersal in driving
community patterns. We sought to determine the influence of
connectivity, water regime, water source, geographical location, and
dispersal traits on patterns of aquatic invertebrate diversity across a
continent-wide arid biome. We compiled data on freshwater invertebrate
assemblages from sites spanning the breadth of arid Australia.
Univariate analyses (analysis of variance and rarefaction) revealed that
alpha and gamma diversity across sites decreased as latitude increased.
Multivariate analyses (ordination and analysis of similarity) revealed
that community composition had considerable fidelity to geographic
regions. Hydrological connectivity was strongly associated with riverine
community composition although water rarely flowed (often less than
annually). Hydrologically isolated sites (springs and rockholes)
supported communities that were markedly dissimilar to hydrologically
connected sites, and to each other. We investigated the influence of
dispersal on diversity patterns by examining distance decay
relationships for each of four dispersal trait groups (obligate aquatic
and passive, weak, and strong aerial dispersers) on the basis of
geodesic (shortest path) distances between pairs of sites and Mantel
tests. We did not detect clear differences between dispersal traits and
distance decay relationships at the continental scale, even for the two
groups with the lowest dispersal ability (obligate aquatics and passive
dispersers). Our results suggest that the loss of hydrological
connectivity from water developments in arid lands (for example, the
impoundment of intermittent rivers) is likely to affect
macroinvertebrates. However, the exact flow mechanisms underlying such
changes remain to be determined.},

abstract = {Non-spatial ecological networks provide insight into the organization
and interaction between biological entities. More recently, biological
dispersal is modelled using spatial networks, static sets of
georeferenced habitat patches that connect based on a species' maximum
dispersal distance. However, dispersal is complex, where spatial
patterns at the landscape scale emerge from interactions between
ecological entities and landscape features at much finer individual
scales. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a computational representation of
complex systems capable of capturing this complexity. Therefore, this
study develops a network-ABM (N-ABM) that combines network and complex
systems theory to simulate complex evolving spatial networks. The
developed N-ABM approach is implemented on the case study of the emerald
ash borer (EAB) bark beetle using geospatial datasets in Ontario,
Canada. The N-ABM generates dynamic spatial network structures that
emerge from interactions between the EAB and tree agents at the
individual scale. The resulting networks are analyzed using graph theory
measures. Analysis of the results indicates a relationship between
preferential attachment in insect host selection and the emergent
scale-free network structure. The N-ABM approach can be used to
represent dynamic ecological networks and provides insight into how
network structure emerges from EAB dispersal dynamics, useful for forest

agriculture and human health, due to its vast production of seeds and
allergenic pollen. Here, we identify the scale and nature of
environmental factors driving individual performance of A.
artemisiifolia, and assess their relative importance. We studied 39
populations across the European continent, covering different climatic
and habitat conditions. We found that plant size is the most important
determinant in variation of per-capita seed and pollen production. Using
plant volume as a measure of individual performance, we found that the
local environment (i.e. the site) is far more influential for plant
volume (explaining 25% of all spatial variation) than geographic
position (regional level; 8%) or the neighbouring vegetation (at the
plot level; 4%). An overall model including environmental factors at
all scales performed better (27%), including the weather (bigger plants
in warm and wet conditions), soil type (smaller plants on soils with
more sand), and highlighting the negative effects of altitude,
neighbouring vegetation and bare soil. Pollen and seed densities varied
more than 200-fold between sites, with highest estimates in Croatia,
Romania and Hungary. Pollen densities were highest on arable fields,
while highest seed densities were found along infrastructure, both
significantly higher than on ruderal sites. We discuss implications of
these findings for the spatial scale of management interventions against

Little information is available with regard to genetic diversity, gene flow, and spatial genetic structure (SGS) of acai populations, which are essential for the use, management, and conservation of genetic resources of the species. This research aimed to assess the genetic diversity, inbreeding level, SGS, and gene flow in four ontogenetic stages of a natural E. precatoria population in the Brazilian Amazon, based on 18 microsatellite loci. The study was carried out in a natural population dispersed in an area of about 10 ha. Leaf tissues of 248 plants were mapped and sampled and classified into four ontogenetic stages: reproductive (59), immature (70), young (60), and seedling (59). Genetic diversity indices were high for all ontogenetic stages. The fixation index (F) for all ontogenetic stages was not significantly different from zero, indicating the absence of inbreeding. A significant SGS was found for all ontogenetic stages (68-110 m), indicating seed dispersal over short distances. Paternity analysis detected pollen immigration of 39.1%, a selfing rate of 4.2%, and a mean pollen dispersal distance within the population of 531 m. The results indicate substantial allele input in the population via pollen immigration, contributing to the maintenance of the genetic diversity of the population. However, within a population, the renewal with new progenies selected from seed plants spaced at least 110 m apart is important to avoid collecting seeds from related plants.},

represent unique opportunities to evaluate genetic outcomes of
establishing peripheral populations across broad expansion fronts. Over
the past century, coyotes (Canis latrans) have undergone a pervasive
range expansion and now inhabit every state in the continental United
States. Coyote expansion into eastern North America was facilitated by
anthropogenic landscape changes and followed two broad expansion fronts.
The northern expansion extended through the Great Lakes region and
southern Canada, where hybridization with remnant wolf populations was
common. The southern and more recent expansion front occurred
approximately 40 years later and across territory where gray wolves have
been historically absent and remnant red wolves were extirpated in the
1970s. We conducted a genetic survey at 10 microsatellite loci of 482
coyotes originating from 11 eastern U.S. states to address how divergent
demographic histories influence geographic patterns of genetic
diversity. We found that population structure corresponded to a
north-south divide, which is consistent with the two known expansion
routes. Additionally, we observed extremely high genetic diversity,
which is atypical of recently expanded populations and is likely the
result of multiple complex demographic processes, in addition to
hybridization with other Canis species. Finally, we considered the
transition of allele frequencies across geographic space and suggest the
mid-Atlantic states of North Carolina and Virginia as an emerging
contact zone between these two distinct coyote expansion fronts.},

influencing genotypic diversity and clonal structure. Here, we
determined dispersal patterns and their impact on genetic structure in
Opuntia microdasys, a self-incompatible cactus with three dispersal
units (one sexual and two clonal). We analyzed dispersal, using
experiments at three populations, and assessed multilocus genotypes
(ISSR markers) of all individuals in 10 clumps per population with known
reproductive origin (sexual or clonal). Genotype of all samples,
population structure, and migration between clumps and populations were
assessed with GenAlEx and GenoDive, assuming higher genotypic diversity
and migration when sexual reproduction is more frequent. We determined
the most likely number of genetic clusters with STRUCTURE and GENELAND.
Dispersal differed among populations; primary dispersal occurred at
short distances and was farthest on steep slopes, and dispersal distance
increased after secondary dispersal. Clumps had 116 different multilocus
genotypes in three spatially explicit genetic clusters. We detected
genetic structure at small scale, genotypic diversity among clumps
varied between populations; diversity decreased while clonal dominance
increased, and the most variation occurred among clumps. Genetic
structure was moderate, suggesting gene flow by seed dispersal allows
slight differentiation among population at large scales. Genetic
diversity within clumps was the lowest because dispersal of clonal
propagules was limited and caused genotypic dominance at local scale.
However, the combined dispersal pattern of sexual and clonal dispersal
units is fine-tuned by environmental factors, generating a range of
genetic diversity among clusters and populations. This pattern suggests
that genetic structure of clonal plants is more dynamic than thought,
and dispersal of different types of offspring affects genetic structure
at many scales.},

abstract = {Populations that have historically been isolated from each other are
expected to differ in some heritable features. This divergence could be
due to drift (and other mechanisms of neutral evolution) or differential
adaptation of populations to local conditions. Discriminating between
these two evolutionary trajectories can be difficult, but when possible,
such data provides critical insight into the evolutionary history of a
species. Here, we examine the patterns of geographic variation of two
contact signals regularly produced by disc-winged bats, Thyroptera
tricolor, and discuss possible processes leading to the observed
patterns of differentiation. We compared allopatric populations
separated by an elevational barrier, and estimated genetic distance
using nuclear microsatellite loci. Our findings revealed that the
mountain ridge is permeable to gene flow. Acoustic divergence was
significantly explained by genetic and spatial factors, supporting the
notion that stochastic factors are the main drivers of signal
divergence. Yet, we found different patterns of geographic variation
between the two types of calls. We examine how this variability in the
patterns of acoustic divergence may suggest distinct modes of signal
transmission within and between populations (i.e., social vs genetic
transmission). This work provides further support of the role of random
change shaping communication systems in mammals, and highlights the
importance of studying multiple elements of a species repertoire to
evaluate the underlying processes driving signal evolution.
Despite increasing interest in studying patterns of acoustic divergence,
the relative contribution of adaptive and stochastic processes
underlying variation of acoustic signals remain poorly understood,
particularly in mammals. Our study examines signal divergence in Spix's
disc-winged bats, Thyoptera tricolor, with the goal of understanding the
underlying processes driving signal evolution. Specifically, we studied
whether the patterns of geographic variation of two social signals
regularly emitted by T. tricolor are congruent with patterns of genetic
distance among populations separated by a geographic barrier. We
demonstrate that genetic and spatial distance explains acoustic
variation, which points to stochastic processes as major drivers of
signal divergence in T. tricolor. Notably, we found that the patterns of
geographic variation differ between the two types of calls studied. We
suggest that this variation results from distinct modes of vocal
transmission within populations. Comparison of different signal types
provides additional insight of social pressures shaping call design.},

However, studies to date have focused on the evolution of higher-level mite taxa while much hidden diversity likely occurs at the level of host genera and species. In this study, we examined the diversity and evolution of feather mites infesting six sympatric seabird species from six genera, breeding in the Cape Verde archipelago. We report 32 feather mite morphospecies categorized into ten genera and three families, of which nine correspond to new, undescribed species. Molecular data corroborated morphological species descriptions, except for two morphologically-cryptic, but genetically distinct mite lineages related to Zachvatkinia oceanodromae and Laminalloptes simplex. Using these communities, we then applied a co-structure approach to test the contribution of ectosymbiont and host factors in driving feather mite evolution. Most seabird species hosted specific and unique feather mite species, even under sympatric conditions, and in general, feather mite species exhibited strong host-driven genetic structure. However, patterns of genetic differentiation were variable. That is, some mite species are more generalist than others and mite lineages/haplotypes can be shared by related seabird species. Interestingly, host-specific mites (eg., Zachvatkinia spp.) tend to display much higher intra-specific diversity compared to more generalist mites (eg., Microspalax and Plicatalloptes spp.). We discuss ectosymbiont and host life-history traits that might generate these patterns, such as host dispersal and breeding behavior and/or mite spatial and trophic specialization. Our findings highlight both the vast and largely unrecognized diversity of avian feather mites on seabirds, and the intrinsic complexity of the ecological processes underlying the evolution of these ectosymbionts.},

species, which helps to homogenize species composition between
localities counteracting the natural distance-decay of compositional
similarity between transects without clay lick influence (controls).
Compared to control sites, clay licks forests had higher palm densities,
shorter but more variable individuals in the canopy and understory, a
thinner canopy layer, and denser herbaceous and ground level covers.
These differences were found along the whole length of transects in both
sampled areas types. These results reveal that the presence of discrete
elements (i.e., clay licks) may help to explain the compositional and
structural heterogeneity of Amazonian forests influencing ecological

abstract = {1. Habitat restoration aims to improve local habitat conditions for
threatened species. While such restorations are widespread, rigorous
evaluations of their success are rare. This is especially true of those
considering species dynamics. Increasingly, deadwood is a target for
forest restoration as many species directly and indirectly depend on
this resource.
2. In a broadleaf forest in southern Germany, we explored the effect of
landscape-wide deadwood restoration on the population genetic structure
of the specialist fungus-dwelling saproxylic beetle Bolitophagus
reticulatus. Before 2003, the northern area of this forest was
intensively logged for more than half a century, while the southern part
was less intensively managed. This drove populations of the host fungus
Fomes fomentarius, and consequently the beetle, to local extinction in
the northern part. Only after the first decade of restoration were both
the fungus and its beetles present across all areas of the forest.
3. Using 17 newly developed microsatellite loci, we show that these
beetles exhibit population genetic structuring, mainly influenced by the
north-south divide. However, the low degree of isolation-by-distance,
and the low relatedness of beetles collected from the same trees or
fungus, shows that strong dispersal ability is facilitating the
recolonisation of these forests on the scale of tens of kilometers. In
another 10 years, it is likely that the population will show even less
genetic structuring.
4. Synthesis and applications. Through the recolonisation of the fungus
Fomes fomentarius and the fungus-dwelling beetle Bolitophagus
reticulatus after deadwood restoration, we demonstrate that, while there
are many discussions on the optimal spatial distribution of deadwood,
just the presence of deadwood can be sufficient to enable
recolonisations of specific species. As long as some relict populations
of these species are embedded in a once intensively managed forest,
increased deadwood (amount and diversity) anywhere will benefit

abstract = {Individual phenotypic differences are increasingly recognized as key drivers of ecological processes. However, studies examining the relative importance of these differences in comparison with environmental factors or how individual phenotype interacts across different environmental contexts remain lacking. We performed two field experiments to assess the concurrent roles of personality differences and habitat quality in mediating individual mortality and dispersal. We quantified the predator avoidance response of mud crabs, Panopeus herbstii, collected from low- and high-quality oyster reefs and measured crab loss in a caging experiment. We simultaneously measured the distance crabs traveled as well as the stability of personalities across reef quality in a separate reciprocal transplant experiment. Habitat quality was the primary determinant of crab loss, although the distance crabs traveled was governed by personality which interacted with habitat quality to control the fate of crabs. Here, crabs on low-quality reefs rapidly emigrated, starting with the boldest individuals, and experienced modest levels of predation regardless of personality. In contrast, both bold and shy crabs would remain on high-quality reefs for months where bolder individuals experienced higher predation risk. These findings suggest that personalities could produce vastly different population dynamics across habitat quality and govern community responses to habitat degradation.},

similar across cities, but varied across neighbourhoods within cities.
All four populations exhibited high spatial autocorrelation at the

Coancestry and evolutionary clustering analyses identified genetic
discontinuities within each city that coincided with a resource desert
in New York City, major waterways in New Orleans, and roads in Salvador

generality of predictions from urban evolution, and have practical
applications for pest management and public health. Future studies

inhabiting complex spatial environments however, it is unclear how the
balance between gene flow and selection may be influenced by landscape
heterogeneity and environmental variation. Here, we evaluated the
effects of dendritic landscape structure and the selective forces of
hydroclimatic variation on population genomic parameters for the Murray
River rainbowfish, Melanotaenia fluviatilis across the Murray-Darling
Basin, Australia. We genotyped 249 rainbowfish at 17,503 high-quality
SNP loci and integrated these with models of network connectivity and
high-resolution environmental data within a riverscape genomics
framework. We tested competing models of gene flow before using
multivariate genotype-environment association (GEA) analysis to test for
signals of adaptive divergence associated with hydroclimatic variation.
Patterns of neutral genetic variation were consistent with expectations
based on the stream hierarchy model and M. fluviatilis' moderate
dispersal ability. Models incorporating dendritic network structure
suggested that landscape heterogeneity is a more important factor
determining connectivity and gene flow than waterway distance. Extending
these results, we also introduce a novel approach to controlling for the
unique effects of dendritic network structure in GEA analyses of
populations of aquatic species. We identified 146 candidate loci
potentially underlying a polygenic adaptive response to seasonal
fluctuations in stream flow and variation in the relative timing of
temperature and precipitation extremes. Our findings underscore an
emerging predominant role for seasonal variation in hydroclimatic

equalizing the species' representation in the seed rain. Rare species
may benefit from enhanced dispersal if frugivores prefer locally scarce
fruits, or if rare plants are found in neighborhoods of high fruit
density. Using a simulation model of frugivorous birds foraging on
landscapes we tested if increased diversity in the seed rain could
emerge from rare-biased fruit selection, from the spatial configuration
of plants, or both. In the absence of rare-biased fruit selection,
frugivores were not able to increase the diversity of the seed rain in
any of our simulated landscapes. In contrast, when frugivores were
attracted to locally scarce fruits, we found increased diversity in the
seed rain whenever frugivore mobility across the landscape was high and
plant species were well-mixed in the fruiting neighborhoods.
Irrespectively of the behavioral mechanism involved, landscape
fragmentation lead to losses in diversity and species richness of
simulated communities. In all simulations, density-dependent mortality
of dispersed seeds increased diversity in the community of seedlings.
However, landscape homogenization at the scale of frugivores movements
decreased the magnitude of this diversification effect. In summary, our
study shows that frugivory has the potential to increase diversity in
the seed rain when frugivores display rare-biased fruit choices,
provided that rare and common plants form heterogeneous neighborhoods.
They also show that fragmentation is a major threat for diversity
maintenance in the early-regenerating community. Finally, they show that
rarity confers advantages during regeneration only if it occurs at the

well recognized, the fundamental role of geographic diversification

importance during the adaptive radiation process. We examined the
relationship between lineage and regional diversification patterns in
the South American rodent subfamily Sigmodontinae, one of the best
candidates for an adaptive radiation in mammals, to propose a conceptual
framework for geographic transitions during adaptive radiations. We
reconstructed a time-calibrated phylogeny from four nuclear genes and
one mitochondrial gene for 77% of sigmodontine diversity. Historical
biogeography was reconstructed among 14 regions, for which we applied a
sliding-window approach to estimate regional transition rates through
time. We compared these rate patterns and measured whether regions
consisted of species that were more phylogenetically related than
expected by chance. Following the initial South American colonization
around 7 million years ago, multiple expansions from northern regions
correlated with a burst of speciation. Subsequently, both
diversification and regional transition rates decreased overall and
within the majority of regions. Despite high regional transition rates,
nearly all regional assemblages were phylogenetically clustered,
indicating that within-region diversification was common. We conclude
that biogeographic complexity and partitioning played a profound role in

population-level reproductive investment is a puzzle.
2. We used a spatially explicit approach in order to examine DDD effects
on Sorbus aucuparia crop sizes for a continuous period of 16 years. Our
special interest was to investigate whether and how DDD processes affect
long-term individual plant reproductive success (PRS) and whether such
processes vary between years of relatively high and low population-level

3. Our study revealed that DDD processes of fruit crop relate to
population-level reproductive investment. In most years, including all
years with low and most years with moderate reproductive investment, no
positive or negative DDD was found for PRS. However, significant
negative density-dependent effects were found during most years of high
and some years of moderate reproductive investment. During these years,
the individual reproductive success decreased with increasing density of
conspecifics.
4. The overall accumulated long-term negative density-dependent pattern
of PRS was determined by few sporadic years of high reproductive
investment, rather than by the most frequent years of low or moderate

agriculture start earlier in the south than in the north? How did the
vegetation change in different regions after the introduction of
agriculture?
LocationCoast of SW and W Norway.
MethodsThe REVEALS (Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from
Large Sites) model is applied for pollen-based vegetation reconstruction
in 19 time windows over the last 9,000years. Pollen data from 63 sites
(lakes and bogs) are compiled and systematically used for data analysis
so that the structure of vegetation change in space and time is
captured.
ResultsEstimated cover of selected trees, shrubs, Calluna, graminids and
herbs indicate a partly open outer coast throughout the Holocene. The
highest tree cover is estimated for 8,200-6,200cal. BP. Broad-leaved
trees (Fraxinus, Quercus, Tilia and Ulmus) spread from south to north
and were present in the whole region at the end of the Mesolithic
(5,950cal. BP). Larger spatial variation in tree cover and a step-wise
reduction in deciduous trees after 5,700cal. BP is concordant with
increases in open-land taxa indicating human activity. Vegetation
changes caused by agriculture are indicated in the very south from ca.
5,950cal. BP. Distinct human-induced vegetation changes with spatial
differentiation took place from 4,200 to 1,700cal. BP, when most of the
areas earlier covered by deciduous woodland had been transformed to
cultivated fields, grasslands and heathlands. Increased Poaceae cover
from 1,700cal. BP probably reflects the expansion of mown meadows in
addition to pastures.
ConclusionsCapturing continuous changes of vegetation structure in space
and time elucidates open areas along the western coast prior to the
introduction of agriculture. Agriculture started earliest in the very
south and spread rapidly along the whole coast prior to the Late
Neolithic. Differences within the study area have existed in all time
periods, reflecting different land-use practices adapted to different
natural conditions.},

because inventorying large suites of taxa is either not feasible or too

using both correlational and representation-based approaches at the
spatial scales at which conservation management occurs. Here, we
evaluated the effectiveness of five ecologically contrasting taxa
(birds, herpetofauna, wild bees, beetles, trees) as cross-taxonomic
surrogates in native woodland patches within a heavily modified, farming
and plantation-dominated landscape. We first compared species richness
and compositional heterogeneity across taxa before testing for
cross-taxonomic congruence using a correlative approach. We then
quantified how well each taxon incidentally represented other taxa in
their best patch sets, and the costs of doing so using a
complementarity-based approach. We found significant pairwise
associations between some taxa (birds, bees), but no single taxon was
strongly correlated with all other taxa. Woodland patch sets prioritised
for beetles represented other taxa best, followed by birds, but were the
costliest and required the largest amount of woodland. This contrasted
with patch sets prioritised for wild bees or herpetofauna, which
achieved higher representation of other taxa at lower costs. Our study
highlighted the influence of taxon-specific patterns of diversity and
heterogeneity on how remnant vegetation patches should be prioritised
for conservation, a consideration not immediately obvious in correlative
analyses of surrogacy. Second, taxa that are not the most speciose (e.g.
wild bees) can be efficient surrogates, achieving higher incidental
representation for other taxa at lower costs. Thus, while species-rich
taxa are ideal as surrogates for prioritising conservation, conservation
planners should not overlook the potential of less speciose taxa such as
bees, while considering the cost-effectiveness of surveying multiple
different taxa.},

aggregated spatial patterns; infants and immatures were randomly
distributed; adults, seeds and seedlings attracted each other while
adult, juveniles and immatures repulsed each other. Infant and seedling
mortality rates were related to DDM and the recruitment from infant to
juvenile was more influenced by spatial heterogeneity. Attraction was
determined by local dispersal; repulsion was related to DDM and

Despite its enormous potential, gNIS has rarely been applied to small

diversity was similar using data from tissues and gNIS. Kinship analysis
showed a higher number of inferred relationships and dispersal events

Location: Australia.
Time Period: 1983-2012.
Major Taxa Studied: Plants.
Methods: To quantify the scale and spatial patterns of this disparity,
we estimated the existing tolerance to thermal extremes of 7,124
Australian plants, more than one-third of the native continental flora,
using data from cultivated records at 128 botanical gardens and
nurseries. Hierarchical Bayesian beta regression was used to assess
whether factors such as realized niches, traits or phylogeny could
predict the incidence or magnitude of niche truncation (underestimation
of thermal tolerances), while controlling for sources of collection
bias.
Results: Approximately half of the cultivated species analysed could
tolerate temperature extremes beyond those experienced in their native
range. Niche truncation was predictable from the breadth and extremes of
their realized niches and by traits such as plant growth form.
Phylogenetic relationships with niche truncation were weak and appeared
more suited to predicting thermal tolerances directly.
Main conclusions: This study highlights a widespread disparity between
realized and potential thermal limits that may have significant
implications for species' capacity to persist in situ with a changing
climate. Identifying whether thermal niche truncation is the result of
biotic interactions, dispersal constraints or other environmental
factors could provide significant insight into community assembly at
macroecological scales. Estimating niche truncation may help to explain
why certain ecological communities are more resilient to change and may
potentially improve the reliability of model projections under climate
change.},

species replacements showed many cases of nonrandom structure and
widespread species turnover. This outcome was repeated across spatial

Turnover dominated across the U.S. and two watersheds spanning

patterns in and drivers of variation in species composition along the
environmental gradients in understudied regions is crucial for
understanding ecosystem vulnerability and resilience. Terrestrial plant
communities of interior Alaska are dominated by three major groups of
primary producers-vascular plants, mosses, and macrolichens. Recent work
has demonstrated broad-scale positive correlations in species richness
patterns among these three functional groups across scales in this
region. However, the conspicuous and fundamental differences in
reproductive strategies, dispersal ability, and physiological
adaptations among these functional groups prompted us to investigate how
community composition and species turnover vary across environmental
gradients among these disparate groups. We hypothesized that species
turnover would be greater in vascular plants than for spore-producing
cryptogam functional groups across gradients of elevation, vegetation
type, and distance due to underlying differences in dispersal abilities
and the temporal and spatial resolution of habitat preferences among
these disparate groups. To address these issues, we compiled a uniquely
comprehensive species composition dataset in interior Alaska utilizing a
multi-stage systematic design. We analyzed community similarity using
Morisita-Horn index of multi-community similarity among all pairs of
vegetation types and elevation bands for each functional group and used
regression analysis to quantify the rate at which compositional
similarity decayed with geographical distance among groups. Our study
reveals consistently higher compositional variation (lower similarity)
among vascular plants as compared to mosses and macrolichens across
landscape gradients and spatial scales in interior Alaska. We also found
that the decay of similarity with distance was less for both of the
cryptogam groups than for vascular plants. Taken together, our results
suggest that differences in functional group dispersal abilities, in
combination with varying abilities to utilize fine-scale temporal and
spatial habitat variation, result in reduced turnover among mosses and
macrolichens as compared to vascular plants both along landscape
gradients and across distance in interior Alaska.},

with microsatellite polymorphisms. These results suggest regular
long-distance gene flow via pollen. At much finer spatial scales within
plots, estimates of relatedness were higher (albeit very low) between
nearest neighbors than random plants, and declined with increasing
distance between neighbors, which is consistent with highly localized
seed dispersal. High selfing should yield SGS, but strong inbreeding
depression in A. canadensis likely erodes SGS so that reproductive
plants exhibit weak structure typical of outcrossers, especially given
that outcrossing and consequent gene flow in this species are mediated
by strong-flying hummingbirds and bumble bees.},

abstract = {Aim Understanding how spatial distributions of rare and common species
are associated with environmental and spatial processes is essential to
understanding community assembly. We addressed the following questions:
(a) does the relative importance of space and topography vary from rare
to common tree species? (b) Are the contributions of topography and
space equal? (c) Are the variances explained by topography or space
correlated with elevational ranges (ER) at the local scale? (d) Does
cell-size influence those postulated associations? Location Major taxa
studied China and the Americas. Tree species. Methods Results We
partitioned the variation in species richness and composition of rare
and common tree species by topography and space across a range of
extents and grain sizes in eight communities. We calculated contribution
ratio (CR) between space and topography to quantify their relative
importance. We employed Kendall's rank correlation to determine the
relation between CR and commonness. Mixed effect models were used to
identify the influence of cell-size on the results. The majority of CR
values were positively related to increasing commonness, especially for
composition. The explained variances by space were always higher than
that by topography regardless of commonness. At local scale, variances
explained by space or topography were not correlated with ER. Main
conclusions Our results indicate that the relative importance of space
compared to topography increases from rare to common species across
forests. We suggest that future studies of community assembly need to
account for both space and topography to adequately describe differences
in rare and common species assembly mechanisms at range of spatial
extents and grain sizes.},

abstract = {Whether there are ecological limits to species diversification is a
hotly debated topic. Molecular phylogenies show slowdowns in lineage
accumulation, suggesting that speciation rates decline with increasing
diversity. A maximum-likelihood (ML) method to detect
diversity-dependent (DD) diversification from phylogenetic branching
times exists, but it assumes that diversity-dependence is a global
phenomenon and therefore ignores that the underlying species
interactions are mostly local, and not all species in the phylogeny
co-occur locally. Here, we explore whether this ML method based on the
nonspatial diversity-dependence model can detect local
diversity-dependence, by applying it to phylogenies, simulated with a
spatial stochastic model of local DD speciation, extinction, and
dispersal between two local communities. We find that type I errors
(falsely detecting diversity-dependence) are low, and the power to
detect diversity-dependence is high when dispersal rates are not too
low. Interestingly, when dispersal is high the power to detect
diversity-dependence is even higher than in the nonspatial model.
Moreover, estimates of intrinsic speciation rate, extinction rate, and
ecological limit strongly depend on dispersal rate. We conclude that the
nonspatial DD approach can be used to detect diversity-dependence in
clades of species that live in not too disconnected areas, but parameter
estimates must be interpreted cautiously.},

passive wind dispersal - the ``flying{''} collembolans - and a
settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should
take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other

abstract = {Aim: Aphyllophoroid fungi are associated with plants, either using
plants as a resource (as parasites or decomposers) or as symbionts (as
mycorrhizal partners). In spite of their strong association with plants,
it is unknown how much plant distributions determine their
biogeographical patterns compared with environmental factors such as
climate and human land use. In this study, our aims are to (1) describe
the spatial diversity patterns of aphyllophoroid fungi in Europe and (2)
identify the factors shaping these patterns.
Location: Europe, as well as the adjacent Subarctic to Arctic islands
(Greenland, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Svalbard), Palestine and the
south-east coast of the Caspian Sea.
Methods: We compiled a dataset consisting of 14,030 fruitbody
occurrences of 1,491 aphyllophoroid fungal species from 39 geographical
areas (17 countries) belonging to eight biogeographical regions. We
assessed the differences in fungal species richness and overall
diversity and its nestedness and turnover components across
biogeographical regions of Europe, as well as between southern and
northern Europe (based on geographical latitude of 50 degrees as
threshold). We used cluster and ordination analyses to classify the
European aphyllophoroid communities biogeographically and evaluated the
importance of climate, host-tree species, topography and human land-use
intensity in explaining biogeographical variation.
Results: The importance of biogeographical regions in determining
European aphyllophoroid fungal communities varies for different
diversity components. Species richness and nestedness are best explained
by plant-based biogeographical regions, whereas overall beta diversity
and species turnover are driven mostly by variation in climate, and
nestedness mostly by tree species occupancy. Beta-diversity patterns of
aphyllophoroid fungi do not differ between southern and northern Europe.
Main conclusions: At the continental scale, aphyllophoroid fungi are
less shaped by historical legacies than vascular plant and animal
communities, and trends of overall beta diversity in southern and
northern Europe are similar to patterns found for bryophytes.},

Low-intensity farming can offer potential retreats for these species, while spontaneous dispersal between such fields is unlikely. Thus, reintroduction of endangered species is necessary to restore agrobiodiversity. To test the applicability under real farm conditions, we seeded a mixture of three winter annuals (Legousia speculum-veneris, Consolida regalis, Lithospermum arvense) at 850 seeds/m(2) on four organic farms near Munich, Germany, in autumn 2011. Seed production and soil seed banks were investigated on four plots within one field on each farm for 3years. In addition, we evaluated seed dispersal caused by arable management along the main machining direction. In the first year, winter cereals were cultivated and the study species emerged at all sites with a seed production mostly exceeding the initial sowing rates. In the third year, species establishment varied depending on crop rotations. Seed production of L. speculum-veneris was higher than in the two other species, and exceeded the number of originally sown seeds up to 20 times. While L. speculum-veneris became very common in the seed bank, C. regalis was less abundant and L. arvense hardly developed a soil seed bank. Seeds of L. speculum-veneris and L. arvense were found up to 15m and seeds of C. regalis up to 13m away from the sown plots. We suggest using seed production, seed bank, and dispersal as key indicators to evaluate establishment of reintroduced arable plants.},

These associations can alter population dynamics and evolutionary trajectories. Large carnivores increasingly occupy urban peripheries, yet the ecological consequences for populations established entirely within urban and exurban landscapes are largely unknown. We applied a spatial and landscape genetics approach, using noninvasively collected genetic data, to identify differences in black bear spatial genetic patterns across a rural-to-urban gradient and quantify how development affects spatial genetic processes. We quantified differences in black bear dispersal, spatial genetic structure, and migration between differing levels of development within a population primarily occupying areas with >6houses/km(2) in western Connecticut. Increased development disrupted spatial genetic structure, and we found an association between increased housing densities and longer dispersal. We also found evidence that roads limited gene flow among bears in more rural areas, yet had no effect among bears in more developed ones. These results suggest dispersal behavior is condition-dependent and indicate the potential for landscapes intermixing development and natural land cover to facilitate shifts toward increased dispersal. These changes can affect patterns of range expansion and the phenotypic and genetic composition of surrounding populations. We found evidence that subpopulations occupying more developed landscapes may be sustained by male-biased immigration, creating potentially detrimental demographic shifts.},

abstract = {The ongoing down-sizing of the global mammal communities is assumed to
have subsequent effects on mutualistic species communities. Dung beetles
co-evolved with large-sized animals since millennia and depend on the
megafauna feces of an appropriate size. Mammal community down-sizing as
a result of past and ongoing megafauna losses is therefore likely to
result in a down-sizing of dung beetle communities. However, empirical
evidence for this co-down-sizing is lacking especially on larger spatial
scales and over extended periods of time. Here, we show a significant
down-sizing of European dung beetle assemblages over the last 53 000
years by relating Quaternary fossil records with trait information on
body size of beetles. This significant down-sizing of dung beetle
communities was thereby not linear, but characterized by a weak decrease
until the early Holocene but a strong acceleration in the recent
pre-history, from 6-7000 years BP onwards. This acceleration of
down-sizing coincides with the completion of the Quaternary megafauna
extinction and the start of major shifts in human agricultural land-use.
In contrast, assemblage mean body size of non-coprophagous scarabids as
well as ground beetles - two groups of beetles with no or weak relations
to megafauna - was observed to increase towards the present with an
acceleration of body size increase coinciding with the onset of
late-glacial warming (14 200 years BP). In summary, the observed
late-Quaternary down-sizing of European dung beetle communities is
consistent with an effect of pre-historic megafauna losses, and not with
the coincident general warming. Ongoing down-sizing of mammal
communities is therefore likely to result in further down-sizing of dung
beetle assemblages, with potential effects on their important role for
nutrient cycling and secondary seed dispersal in natural and extensive
agro-ecosystems. Future nature management initiatives could halt or even
reverse this functional diversity loss via effective protection or
restoration of megafauna communities.},

paradorsalis, and examine the role of adjacent land bridge and

LocationThe Lower Guineo-Congolian Forest, the Cameroonian Volcanic Line
(CVL), and Bioko Island, Central Africa.
TaxonAfrixalus paradorsalis (Family: Hyperoliidae), an African
leaf-folding frog.
MethodsWe used molecular and phenotypic data to investigate diversity
and divergence among the A. paradorsalis species complex distributed
across lowland rain forests, a land bridge island, and mountains in
Central Africa. We examined the coincidence of population boundaries,
landscape features, divergence times, and spatial patterns of
connectivity and diversity, and subsequently performed demographic
modelling using genome-wide SNP variation to distinguish among
divergence mechanisms in mainland (riverine barriers, forest refugia,
ecological gradients) and land bridge island populations (vicariance,
overwater dispersal).
ResultsWe detected four genetically distinct allopatric populations
corresponding to Bioko Island, the CVL, and two lowland rain forest
populations split by the Sanaga River. Although lowland populations are
phenotypically indistinguishable, pronounced body size evolution occurs
at high elevation, and the timing of the formation of the high elevation
population coincides with mountain uplift in the CVL. Spatial analyses
and demographic modelling revealed population divergence across mainland
Lower Guinea is best explained by forest refugia rather than riverine
barriers or ecological gradients, and that the Bioko Island population
divergence is best explained by vicariance (marine incursion) rather
than overseas dispersal.
Main conclusionsWe provide growing support for the important role of
forest refugia in driving intraspecific divergences in the
Guineo-Congolian rain forest. In A. paradorsalis, sky-islands in the CVL
have resulted in greater genetic and phenotypic divergences than marine
incursions of the land bridge Bioko Island, highlighting important
differences in patterns of island-driven diversification in Lower
Guinea.},

abstract = {1. Interactions between established (canopy) and recruiting individuals
(recruits) are pervasive in plant communities. Studies on recruitment in
forests have mainly focused on negative density-dependent conspecific
interactions, while the outcomes of heterospecific canopy-recruit
interactions have received much less attention and are generally assumed
to be driven by stochastic processes.
2. Herein, we explore the relative influence of stochastic (abundance)
and deterministic (species identity and phylogenetic distance) effects
on the frequency of canopy-recruit interactions and characterize the
interactions in terms of their spatial consistency and effect on
recruitment (depressing, neutral or enhancing).
3. In 12 plots (50 x 50 m) of mixed pine-oak forests in southern Spain,
we identified all saplings recruiting beneath 56 shrub and tree species,
and in open areas not covered by woody plants. We used generalized
linear mixed models to investigate the influence of stochastic and
deterministic processes on the frequency of canopy-recruit interactions,
on their spatial consistency and their effects on recruitment, and
applied neutral null models to evaluate the spatial consistency in the
occurrence of interactions across plots.
4. Deterministic and stochastic interactions were equally common,
emphasizing the prevalence of non-neutral effects. Among the realized
interactions, 36.8% enhanced recruitment, 49.05% were neutral, and
14.1% depressed recruitment. Many potential interactions (42.08%) were
not observed in any study sites, presumably due to the scarcity of the
interacting species. Moreover, the probability that two species formed a
canopy-recruit interaction, the frequency of their interaction and the
probability that the interaction had an enhancing effect on recruitment,
all increased with the phylogenetic distance between the interacting
species. However, the prevalence of these effects depended on the
recruitment environment (heterospecific, conspecific or open).
Recruitment-enhancing interactions between heterospecifics were more
consistently realized in different sites than neutral or depressing
interactions.
5. The establishment of canopy-recruit interactions (which species
recruits beneath which others, and how often) is not simply determined
by stochastic events. Indeed, due to their prevalence, we argue that
deterministic canopy-recruit interactions are important drivers of plant
community dynamics.},

we explored the association between several environmental variables and
the termite's distribution pattern in Paris; since 2000, a total of 2106
infestations have been recorded. Second, we inferred termite population

microsatellite loci. Third, we used least-cost models and partial Mantel
tests to study the effects of environmental variables on the termite's
population genetic structure. Our analyses revealed that
building-related variables were significantly associated with termite
infestations and could thus help explain the termite's spatial
distribution pattern. Furthermore, railway networks also explain termite
propagation and genetic patterns. Additionally, we found that the
termite's spread is likely driven by budding dispersal, which may be
constrained by buildings and roads. Even if budding dispersal could
facilitate R. flavipes' spread in urban areas, it cannot explain the
termite's distribution in Paris all on its own. Indeed, termite
propagation seems to be significantly driven by anthropogenic

statistical models at two spatial scales. At the local scale (within the
dispersal distances of the species), sites occupied by martens were
compared with unoccupied sites using buffers of different sizes, whereas
at the regional scale, unoccupied sites were selected randomly. To
adjust for spatial autocorrelation of data, penalised quasi-likelihood
approximations were used. Both species of martens demonstrated
preferences for areas with higher proportions of forest cover and
steeper terrain. At the local, but not at the regional, scale, pine
martens occurred at lower elevations, whilst stone martens occurred at
higher elevations. We found that climatic variables (mean temperature,
precipitation) had no significant effect on the presence of the martens.
The results of our analyses generally confirmed findings of previous

We assessed the effects of landscape and habitat filters on the species
richness, abundance and trait composition of grassland specialist and
generalist plants in small habitat islands. We studied traits related to
functional spatial connectivity (dispersal ability by wind and animals)
and temporal connectivity (clonality and seed bank persistence) using
model selection.
We sampled herbaceous plants, landscape (local and regional isolation)
and habitat filters (inclination, woody encroachment and disturbance) in
82 grassland islands in Hungary.
Isolation decreased the abundance of good disperser specialist plants
due to the lack of directional vectors transferring seeds between
suitable habitat patches. Clonality was an effective strategy, but
persistent seed bank did not support the survival of specialist plants
in isolated habitats. Generalist plants were unaffected by landscape
filters due to their wide habitat breadth and high propagule
availability. Clonal specialist plants could cope with increasing woody
encroachment due to their high resistance against environmental changes;
however, they could not cope with intensive disturbance. Steep slopes
providing environmental heterogeneity had an overall positive effect on
species richness.
Specialist plants were influenced by the interplay of landscape filters
influencing their abundance and habitat filters affecting species
richness. Landscape filtering by isolation influenced the abundance of
specialist plants by regulating seed dispersal. Habitat filters sorted
species that could establish and persist at a site by influencing
microsite availability and quality.},

abstract = {Seed and pollen dispersal shape patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity in plants. Pollen is generally thought to travel longer distances than seeds, but seeds determine the ultimate location of gametes. Resolving how interactions between these two dispersal processes shape microevolutionary processes is a long-standing research priority. We unambiguously isolated the separate and combined contributions of these two dispersal processes in seedlings of the animal-dispersed palm Oenocarpus bataua to address two questions. First, what is the spatial extent of pollen versus seed movement in a system characterized by long-distance seed dispersal? Second, how does seed dispersal mediate seedling genetic diversity? Despite evidence of frequent long-distance seed dispersal, we found that pollen moves much further than seeds. Nonetheless, seed dispersal ultimately mediates genetic diversity and fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Compared to undispersed seedlings, seedlings dispersed by vertebrates were characterized by higher female gametic and diploid seedling diversity and weaker fine-scale spatial genetic structure for female gametes, male gametes and diploid seedlings. Interestingly, the diversity of maternal seed sources at seed deposition sites (N-em) was associated with higher effective number of pollen sources (N-ep), higher effective number of parents (N-e) and weaker spatial genetic structure, whereas seed dispersal distance had little impact on these or other parameters we measured. These findings highlight the importance maternal seed source diversity (N-em) at frugivore seed deposition sites in driving emergent patterns of fine-scale genetic diversity and structure.},

abstract = {Technological advancements have spurred rapid growth in the study of
migratory connectivity, the linkage of individuals and populations
between seasons of the annual cycle. The strength of migratory
connectivity is a measure of the co-occurrence of populations throughout
the annual cycle and can be represented by a correlation of the
distances between individuals during one season and another (Mantel
correlation, r(M)). However, measurement of seasonal distributions most
often involves incomplete sampling and use of technologies that vary in
accuracy and precision. For these reasons, we expanded r(M) to measure
the strength of migratory connectivity (MC) with population-specific
transition probabilities that can be derived from many data types and
uneven sampling.
We explore the sensitivity of MC to possible real-world variation in
input parameters: transition probabilities, abundance among regions,
spatial arrangement of regions, and sample sizes. We compare MC to r(M),
present a series of resampling approaches for propagating uncertainty in
input values into estimation of MC and r(M), and validate the method
with bird tracking data.
Migratory connectivity was negative when populations are further apart
between seasons, positive when populations remain together between
seasons, and zero when populations have no patterns in distribution
between seasons. MC is most sensitive to transition probabilities and
spatial arrangement of regions and performs better than r(M) when
sampling effort is not proportional to true abundance, and when the
strength of migratory connectivity varies across the range of the
species. Our estimators for MC and r(M) performed well across several
data types.
We hope that these methods and the MigConnectivity r package will
facilitate quantitative comparisons of migratory connectivity across
studies, data types, and taxa to better understand the causes and
consequences of the seasonal distributions of populations. Several study
design recommendations emerge from our simulations: (1) incorporate
abundance among regions when sampling is not proportional; (2)measure
transition probabilities across as much of the range as logistically
possible; (3) define study regions with either biological information
about population delineation, or use discrete study locations as
centroids of regions; and (4) estimate and report uncertainty from
appropriate sources of sampling and process errors.},

important aspect for effective long-term conservation of these
populations. We assessed habitat requirements of the Aesculapian snake
(Zamenis longissimus) in an isolated population at the northern limits
of its range, southeastern Poland. We analyzed factors affecting the
species' distribution at different spatial scales. We used the area of
its current distribution (22,754ha) in Poland to analyze macrohabitat
patterns at the landscape scale and used the area currently occupied by
the largest local population (2,192ha) to analyze macro- and
microhabitat use. Additionally, at 25 sites delimited around individual
and clusters of snake records (140.7ha), we characterized the detailed
forest composition. Landscape-scale analyses confirmed the Aesculapian
snake's preference for deciduous forest. At the medium spatial scale,
anthropogenic macro- and microhabitat features had a positive effect on
the presence and abundance of the species. Its distribution was
positively associated with warm river valleys, and we recorded the
highest numbers of snakes in areas with average annual temperatures
between 5.95 degrees C and 6.30 degrees C. At a fine scale, the relative
abundance of the Aesculapian snake was negatively associated with dense
deciduous forest cover but positively associated with open broad-leaf
woodlands. To conserve northern populations of the Aesculapian snake,
clearings should be maintained in forest stands, tree planting and
natural succession should be reduced in open areas, and alder forests
(Alnetum incanae) and small beech forest (Dentario glandulosae-Fagetum)
stands should be protected. Active conservation should include the
creation of artificial reproduction sites and permanent rocky shelters

2. This study investigated the spatial ecology of lake sturgeon
(Acipenser fulvescens) within the barrier free Huron-Erie Corridor
(HEC), which connects Lake Huron and Lake Erie of the North American
Laurentian Great Lakes.
3. Over 6years (2011-2016), movements of 268 lake sturgeon in the HEC
were continuously monitored across the Great Lakes using acoustic
telemetry (10years battery life acoustic transmitters). Five distinct
migration behaviours were identified with hierarchical cluster analysis,
based on the phenology and duration of river and lake use.
4. Lake sturgeon in the HEC were found to contain a high level of
intraspecific divergent migration, including partial migration with the
existence of residents. Specific behaviours included year-round river
residency and multiple lake-migrant behaviours that involved movements
between lakes and rivers. Over 85% of individuals were assigned to
migration behaviours as movements were consistently repeated over the
study, which suggested migration behaviours were consistent and
persistent in lake sturgeon. Differential use of specific rivers or
lakes by acoustic-tagged lake sturgeon further subdivided individuals
into 14 contingents (spatiotemporally segregated subgroups).
5. Contingents associated with one river (Detroit or St. Clair) were
rarely detected in the other river, which confirmed that lake sturgeon
in the Detroit and St. Clair represent two semi-independent populations
that could require separate management consideration for their
conservation. The distribution of migration behaviours did not vary
between populations, sexes, body size or among release locations, which
indicated that intrapopulation variability in migratory behaviour is a
general feature of the spatial ecology of lake sturgeon in unfragmented
landscapes.},

and the preferences of an introduced species is the first prerequisite
for establishment. Yet, introduction areas are usually landscapes, i.e.
heterogeneous sets of habitats that are more or less favourable to the
introduced species. Because individuals are able to disperse after their
introduction, the quality of the habitat surrounding the introduction
site is as critical to the persistence of introduced populations as the
quality of the introduction site itself. Moreover, demographic
mechanisms such as Allee effects or dispersal mortality can hamper
dispersal and affect spread across the landscape, in interaction with
the spatial distribution of favourable habitat patches. In this study,
we investigate the impact of the spatial distribution of heterogeneous
quality habitats on establishment and early spread. First, we simulated
introductions in one-dimensional landscapes for different dispersal
rates and either dispersal mortality or Allee effects. The landscapes
differed by the distribution of favourable and less favourable habitats,
which were either clustered into few large aggregates of the same
quality or scattered into multiple smaller ones. Second, we tested the
predictions of simulations by performing experimental introductions of
hymenopteran parasitoids (Trichogramma chilonis) in `clustered' and
`scattered' microcosm landscapes. Results highlighted two impacts of the
clustering of favourable habitat: by decreasing the risks of dispersal
from the introduction site to unfavourable habitat early during the
invasion, it increased establishment success. However, by increasing the
distance between favourable habitat patches, it also hindered the
subsequent spread of introduced species over larger areas.},

Despite numerous efforts, the relationship between fawn survival and habitat characteristics remains unclear and there has been no attempt to examine trends in survival across landscape types with adequate replication. In 2015-2016, we radiomarked 98 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns in 2 study areas in Pennsylvania. By using a meta-analysis approach, we compared fawn survival estimates from across North America using published data from 29 populations in 16 states to identify patterns in survival and cause-specific mortality related to landscape characteristics, predator communities, and deer population density. We modeled fawn survival relative to percentage of agricultural land cover and deer density. Estimated average survival to 3-6 months of age was 0.4140.062 (SE) in contiguous forest landscapes (no agriculture) and for every 10% increase in land area in agriculture, fawn survival increased 0.049 +/- 0.014. We classified cause-specific mortality as human-caused, natural (excluding predation), and predation according to agriculturally dominated, forested, and mixed (i.e., both agricultural and forest cover) landscapes. Predation was the greatest source of mortality in all landscapes. Landscapes with mixed forest and agricultural cover had greater proportions and rates of human-caused mortalities, and lower proportions and rates of mortality due to predators, when compared to forested landscapes. Proportion and rate of natural deaths did not differ among landscapes. We failed to detect any relationship between fawn survival and deer density. The results highlight the need to consider multiple spatial scales when accounting for factors that influence fawn survival. Furthermore, variation in mortality sources and rates among landscapes indicate the potential for altered landscape mosaics to influence fawn survival rates. Wildlife managers can use the meta-analysis to identify factors that will facilitate comparisons of results among studies and advance a better understanding of patterns in fawn survival.

In tropical regions, countryside habitats that retain abundant tree cover and structurally complex canopies may complement protected areas by providing suitable habitats and landscape connectivity for a significant portion of the native biota. Species with low dispersal capabilities are among the most at risk of extinction as a consequence of land-use change. We assessed how the spatial distribution of the brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus), a model species for a vertebrate with limited dispersal ability, is shaped by differences in habitat structure and landscape patterns of countryside habitats in north-central Costa Rica using a multi-scale framework. We quantified the influence of local habitat characteristics and landscape context on sloth occurrence using mixed-effects logistic regression models. We recorded 27 sloths within countryside habitats and found that both local and landscape factors significantly influenced their spatial distribution. Locally, sloths favored structurally complex habitats, with greater canopy cover and variation in tree height and basal area. At the landscape scale, sloths demonstrated a preference for habitats with high proportions of forest and nearby large tracts of forest. Although mixed-use areas and tree plantations are not substitutes for protected forests, our results suggest they provide important supplemental habitats for sloths. To promote the conservation and long-term viability of sloth populations in the tropical countryside, we recommend that land managers retain structurally complex vegetation and large patches of native habitat.},

generated a novel genome of high assembly quality and genotyped 4735
genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers from 78
individuals of an invasive population of the Javan Myna Acridotheres

subdivision at a micro-geographic level, a genetic patch size (similar
to 13-14 km) indicative of a pronounced dispersal ability, and barely an
increase in effective population size since introduction despite an
increase of four to five orders of magnitude in actual population size,
suggesting that low population-genetic diversity following a bottleneck
has not impeded establishment success. Landscape genomic analyses
identified urban features, such as low-rise neighborhoods, that
constitute pronounced barriers to gene flow. Based on our data, we
consider an approach targeting the complete eradication of Javan Mynas
across Singapore to be unfeasible. Instead, a mixed approach of
localized mitigation measures taking into account urban geographic
features and planning policy may be the most promising avenue to
reducing the adverse impacts of this urban pest. Our study demonstrates
how genomic methods can directly inform the management and control of

some distance downstream of the parent generation, introducing an
asymmetry to the dispersal. Ocean-dwelling species have also been shown
to exhibit chaotic population dynamics. Therefore, we must better
understand chaotic population dynamics under the influence of
asymmetrical dispersal. Here, we examine a density-dependent population
in a current, where the current has both a mean and stochastic
component. In our finite domain, the current moves offspring in the
downstream direction. This system displays a rich variety of dynamics
from chaotic to steady-state, depending on the mean distance the
offspring are moved downstream, the diffusive spread of the offspring,
and the domain size. We find that asymmetric dispersal can act as a
stabilizing or destabilizing mechanism, depending on the size of the
mean dispersal distance relative to the other system parameters. As the
strength of the current increases, the system can experience
period-halving bifurcation cascades. Thus, we show that stability of
chaotic aquatic populations is directly tied to the strength of the
ocean current in their environment, and our model predicts increased
prevalence of chaos with decreasing dispersal distance. Climate change
is likely to alter the dispersal patterns of many species, and so our
results have implications for conservation and management of said
species. We discuss the management implications, particularly of

the strength of the correlation between time series, is a common pattern
that occurs in different regions, types of ecosystems and groups of
organisms. In addition to applied research (optimisation of monitoring
networks and population persistence), spatial synchrony has important
implications for unravelling the processes underlying environmental and
biological dynamics. We quantified the levels of synchrony among six
sites in a tropical reservoir (Lajes Reservoir, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
over 85 months (from August 2001 to December 2009) for twelve
environmental variables, four broad zooplankton groups (testate amoebae,
rotifers, cladocerans and copepods) and 23 abundant taxa. We
hypothesised that (a) environmental synchrony would be higher than
biological synchrony; (b) high synchrony would be found; and (c)
biological synchrony matrices would be positively correlated with
environmental synchrony and negatively correlated with both
environmental and geographic distances. A strong relationship between
biological synchrony and environmental matrices, when compared to
geographic distance, would be consistent with the hypothesis that
similar environmental variability synchronises the dynamics of local
populations (Moran effect). In comparison to previous studies, we found
high levels of synchrony. Environmental synchrony was often higher than
biological synchrony, which was in line with our expectation and
previous findings. The high levels of synchrony found in this study
suggest that reservoir zonation was not enough to desynchronise the
dynamics at the sites for both environmental and biological variables.
Spatial synchrony in zooplankton populations declined more consistently
with environmental distance than with geographic distance. Additionally,
environmental distances were unrelated to geographic distances. Taken
together, these results indicate a preponderant role of the Moran
effect. Thus, as synchrony increases extinction rates, we speculate that
novel ecosystems may be highly susceptible to regional-wide changes in
environmental factors.},

We took advantage of two centuries worth of herbarium data, to evaluate a set of metrics to measure macroscale patterns, allowing cross-species comparisons of invasive expansion across large geographic areas. Methods We used herbarium specimens to reconstruct county-level invasion histories for two non-native plants (Alliaria petiolata and Lonicera japonica), with distinct spatiotemporal distribution patterns over the past two centuries. Using county centroids from species' initial occurrences, we quantified point pattern metrics from multiple disciplines (e.g. urban crime analysis, landscape ecology etc.) that are historically used at smaller spatial scales, to evaluate their ability to detect macroscale spatial diffusion and amount of directional expansion. Metrics were further assessed for their ease of use, data requirements, independence from other metrics and intuitiveness of interpretation. Important Findings We identified four suitable metrics for distinguishing differences in spatial patterns: (i) standard distance, (ii) number of patches, (iii) Euclidean nearest neighbor summary class statistic coefficient of variation and (iv) mean center that when applied to county-level presence data allowed us to determine the directions by which distributions expanded and if distributions increased via outward expansion, infilling and/or jump dispersal events. These metrics when compared during the same invasion phase are capable of quantifying macroscale variability among species in their distributional and dispersal patterns. Being able to quantify differences among species in these patterns is important in understanding the drivers of species dispersal patterns. These metrics therefore represent a simple yet thorough toolset for achieving this goal.},

models have rarely directly considered non-climatic processes. Here, we
use a Joint Species Distribution Model (JSDM) to investigate the
influence of non-climatic factors on species co-occurrence patterns and
to directly quantify the relative influences of climate and alternative
processes that may generate correlated responses in species
distributions, such as species interactions, on tree co-occurrence
patterns.
LocationUS Rocky Mountains.
MethodsWe apply a Bayesian JSDM to simultaneously model the
co-occurrence patterns of ten dominant tree species across the Rocky
Mountains, and evaluate climatic and residual correlations from the
fitted model to determine the relative contribution of each component to
observed co-occurrence patterns. We also evaluate predictions generated
from the fitted model relative to a single-species modelling approach.
ResultsFor most species, correlation due to climate covariates exceeded
residual correlation, indicating an overriding influence of broad-scale
climate on co-occurrence patterns. Accounting for covariance among
species did not significantly improve predictions relative to a
single-species approach, providing limited evidence for a strong
independent influence of species interactions on distribution patterns.
ConclusionsOverall, our findings indicate that climate is an important
driver of regional biodiversity patterns and that interactions between
dominant tree species contribute little to explain species co-occurrence

this fraction of the population. As predicted by life histories of
long-lived organisms, temporal random variation in survival was highest
for immature individuals (1.326, 95% credible interval {[}CRI]
1.290-1.940) and lowest for adults (0.499, 95% CRI 0.487-0.720). Large
temporal fluctuations in the probability of taking a reproductive
sabbatical would partly explain the consistency in adult survival, with
individuals most likely refraining from breeding when environmental
conditions were harsh. Immature survival and fertility were the main
drivers of population dynamics during the study period (r(2) = 0.83,
0.77-0.87 and 0.73, 0.63-0.79, respectively). We found strong evidence
of density dependence, not only due to the number of breeders (r(2) =
-0.34, -0.43 to -0.24) but also due to individuals on sabbatical (r(2) =
-0.18, -0.33 to -0.01). From a conservation point of view, the species
shows a 5% annual global decrease during the last 10 years, and we
propose an update of its conservation status. Even though population
dynamics of long-lived organisms are very sensitive to changes in adult
survival, we show here that, in the absence of strong environmental
perturbations affecting this vital rate, fluctuations in population
density are mainly driven by variations in survival of immature
individuals and fertility. Integrated models based on long-term
monitoring at a global scale may enhance our ecological and evolutionary
understanding of how demographic drivers influence population dynamics.},

of great importance in the fields of biogeography, landscape ecology and

analysis, investigations of spatial effects on biodiversity are still
largely focused on species richness.ObjectivesWe wanted to know if and
how species richness and species composition are differentially driven
by the spatial measures dominating studies in landscape ecology and
biogeography. As both measures require the same limited presence/absence
information, it is important to choose an appropriate diversity measure,
as differing results could have important consequences for interpreting
ecological processes.MethodsWe recorded plant occurrences on 112 islands
in the Baltic archipelago. Species richness and composition were
calculated for each island, and the explanatory power of island area and
habitat heterogeneity, distance to mainland and structural connectivity
at three different landscape sizes were examined.ResultsA total of 354
different plant species were recorded. The influence of landscape
variables differed depending on which diversity measure was used. Island
area and structural connectivity determined plant species richness,
while species composition revealed a more complex pattern, being
influenced by island area, habitat heterogeneity and structural
connectivity.ConclusionsAlthough both measures require the same basic
input data, species composition can reveal more about the ecological
processes affecting plant communities in fragmented landscapes than
species richness alone. Therefore, we recommend that species community
composition should be used as an additional standard measure of
diversity for biogeography, landscape ecology and conservation planning.},

global change, and resident species will likely need to colonize new
sites and exchange migrants to sustain viable local populations. Alpine
habitats often have a high level of protection, yet extensive
environmental heterogeneity and the limited dispersal ability of many
endemic species makes it unclear whether PA networks provide sufficient
connectivity to protect vulnerable species. We assess landscape
connectivity in the European alpine PA network by combining measures of
habitat and genetic connectivity using community landscape genetics
approaches. Examining 27 plant species, we compare levels of genetic
diversity in PA and non-PA sites, and rank non-PA sites for their
potential value in facilitating genetic and habitat connectivity, as
well as preserving species richness in 893 alpine plants. Non-PA sites
do not significantly enhance overall levels of genetic variability
across species. However, spatial genetic turnover (allele frequency
variation across space) is influenced by geographical and environmental
distance, suggesting that genetic connectivity, and by extension
landscape connectivity, is impacted by gaps in the PA network. A subset
of non-PA sites, when measured for habitat connectivity, genetic
connectivity and species richness using spatial graphs, substantially
increase landscape connectivity for alpine plants, although there are
discrepancies among metrics in ranking sites. We provide the first
example of the evaluation and prediction of new PM including levels of
intraspecific genetic diversity for a whole community. This has
significance for the management and extension of the European alpine
network, especially in identifying valuable unprotected sites.},

connectivity patterns, such as the universal dendritic structure of
fluvial networks. These networks not only define dispersal of native
species, but also represent corridors of biological invasions, making
understanding network topology effects on invasion dynamics and
subsequent diversity patterns of high interest. We studied amphipod
community diversity and structure in the upper 27,882-km(2) drainage
basin of the river Rhine in Central Europe, focusing on differences
between native and non-native species. Overall, species richness
increased along the network from headwaters to the outlet nodes. We
found, however, contrasting patterns of native and non-native amphipod
richness along the network, with headwater nodes representing refugia
for native species and more downstream nodes being hotspots of
biological invasions. Importantly, while species turnover
(beta-diversity) of native species increased with distance between nodes
in the network, this was not the case for non-native species, indicating
a much lower dispersal limitation of the latter. Finally, the overall
amphipod community structure closely mirrored the topological modularity
of the network, highlighting the network's imprint on community
structure. Our results underpin the importance of connectivity for
community formation and the significance of rivers for biological

unsustainable strategy: if an entire population is cooperating, each
individual can increase its overall fitness by choosing not to
cooperate, thereby still receiving all the benefit of its cooperating
neighbors while no longer expending its own energy. Observable
cooperation in naturally-occurring public goods games is consequently of
great interest, as such systems offer insight into both the emergence
and sustainability of cooperation. Here we consider a population that
obeys a public goods game on a network of discrete regions (that we call
colonies), between any two of which individuals are free to migrate. We
construct a system of piecewise-smooth ordinary differential equations
that couple the within-colony population dynamics and the between-colony
migratory dynamics. Through a combination of analytical and numerical
methods, we show that if the workers within the population migrate
sufficiently fast relative to the cheaters, the network loses stability
first through a Hopf bifurcation, then a torus bifurcation, after which
one or more colonies collapse. Our results indicate that fast moving
cheaters can act to stabilize worker-cheater coexistence within network
that would otherwise collapse. We end with a comparison of our results
with the dynamics observed in colonies of the ant species Pristomyrmex

breeding site fidelity, recurrent local perturbations, such as
predation-induced breeding failure, may lead individuals to disperse
locally or regionally. This might induce heterogeneity in individual CR
histories and biases in demographic parameter estimates. Here, we
assessed the effect of buffer areas and multi-site designs on annual
survival estimate accuracy and precision. First, using simulated data
with and without a multi-site design, we compared survival estimates for
different scenarios involving contrasted local and regional dispersal.
Then, using data from a local multi-site long-term monitoring survey
carried out in a colony of black-legged kittiwakes, we tested the
homogeneity of individual CR histories and compared survival estimates
from three datasets including one or several breeding cliffs with or
without buffer areas. Results from simulations highlighted that a
single-site design consistently led to underestimated or less precise
survival values compared to a multi-site design. Similarly, a multi-site
design allowed detecting significant temporal trends while a single-site
one did not. In the field-based study, adding buffer areas reduced
individual heterogeneity, but all three datasets suffered from strong
trap-dependence possibly due to individual breeding success affecting
nest-site fidelity. Implementing a multi-site design significantly
improved the accuracy and precision of annual survival estimates,
regardless of CR models applied. Adapting the spatial scale of sampling
design to the local environment and species behaviour is essential to
provide robust parameters of key relevance for population monitoring and

2. Models simulated bird movement, frugivory, seed dispersal and plant

and in their degree of fruiting species mixing at the scale of
frugivores' foraging decisions.
3. Diet complementation promoted the dispersal of rare species without
the need of a priori preference from birds. The effects of landscape
structure on the dispersal of rare plants were small (<5%) compared to
positive effects of diet complementation because birds tracked the
nutrients contained in rare fruits to balance their diets. However,
resource-tracking of rare fruits increased foraging costs up to 20% of
net energy intakes.
4. During postdispersal stages, density-dependent mortality only
conferred advantages to rare plants when located within heterospecific
plant patches. Still, thanks to rare-biased dispersal, rare plants
showed the highest seed dispersal effectiveness irrespectively of
landscape configuration.
5. Our theoretical approach presents a behavioural mechanism by which
fruit choice can act as a frequency-dependent mechanism conferring rare
species advantages as important as classic postdispersal

We quantified the dispersal of propagules of 3 seagrass species (Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera marina) over substrata of different complexities (sand, coarse gravel and P. oceanica mattes of different shoot abundances) under unidirectional flow in a hydraulic flume. Threshold velocities indicate that Z. marina seeds start to move earlier over a flat sandy bottom (14 cm s(-1)) than seeds of P. oceanica (20 cm s(-1)) and C. nodosa (21 cm s(-1)). Propagule trapping increased with bottom complexity, which was related to the flow reduction that each substratum generated and the boundary layer thickness. Trapping rates were higher in coarse gravel and in mattes with higher abundances of dead shoots, where flow was reduced more than 50%. Over sand, flow reduction was minimal and propagules were not trapped. Furthermore, notable differences between P. oceanica early life stages were observed, with seeds trapped first, followed by seedlings of increasing ages. This result may be related to the smaller frontal area (area exposed to water flow) and higher settling velocity of the younger life stages. Together, our results provide important insights into the drivers of seagrass recruitment, which are of interest for restoration purposes and numerical modelling.},

recognized as fundamental factors underlying community assembly along
geographical gradients. We addressed the relative roles of these three
processes on the taxonomic (TBD) and phylogenetic beta diversity (PBD)
among 108 phyllostomid bat assemblages. Considering the bats' dispersal
abilities, niche requirements and tropical origin, we hypothesized that
the current environmental parameters would explain most of the taxonomic
and phylogenetic variation among these communities.
Location: Neotropics.
Methods: We assessed taxonomic and phylogenetic similarities among these
108 communities using species compositional data. To disentangle the
effects of different processes structuring these assemblages, we
conducted variance partitioning using distance-based redundancy
analyses. We also examined the spatial structure of these communities
and used null models to test whether the assemblages are
phylogenetically more or less dissimilar than would be expected by
chance.
Results: Most of the variation in TBD and PBD was accounted for by
spatial processes. Spatial influences were consistent for beta diversity
components and for groups of species with distinct geographical range
sizes. We observed a strong and non-random spatial structure underlying
the taxonomic and phylogenetic community composition. A pairwise
comparison revealed that most communities had random variation with
respect to phylogeny.
Main conclusions: Spatial processes were more effective than
environmental and historical processes in explaining species and
lineages composition of 108 Neotropical phyllostomid assemblages, a
result that could be due to topographic complexities limiting species
dispersal in this region, regardless of the bats' dispersal
capabilities. In contrast to previous studies of patterns of bat
diversity at local and regional scales, our results suggest that the
structure of bat assemblages is related to complementary ecological and
evolutionary processes at different levels of diversity and geographical
scales throughout the Neotropics.},

population, and learn migration routes between spawning and foraging
habitats by following older, experienced fish. Although the adopted
migrant life history may apply to many species of pelagic marine fishes,
there is scant theoretical or empirical work on the consequent

this life history in which the recruitment of juveniles depends on the
relative abundance of the local populations and recruitment overlap,
which measures the ease with which juveniles are recruited by a
nonparental population. We demonstrate that the adopted migrant life

ecosystems (e.g., bare salt marsh areas), this facilitative effect of
vegetation structures on seed retention is often restricted, limiting
vegetation recovery. The role of vegetation structures as seed traps may
be replaced by microtopographic structures, but the effectiveness of
microtopographic structures in seed retention across temporal and
spatial scales has been seldom tested, leaving its application value in
restoration of degraded ecosystems unclear. We tested the facilitative
effect of microtopographic structures on seedling recruitment in
degraded, bare areas in a salt marsh ecosystem. Field experiments
revealed that most (>= 94.4%) microtopographic structures facilitated
seedling recruitment via seed trapping and the number of recruited
seedlings increased with the increasing size and depth treatment of
microtopographic structure. However, when excluded the effect of size,
recruited seedling density decreased with size. Moreover, this trend
will be modified by variation rate in depth at smaller-sized structures,
when the variation in depth was significant. The stability of those
induced microtopographic structures would be influenced by tidal events,
thus tidal frequency can modify the effect of structural characteristics

hypothesis for the stability of biofilms is spatial structure:
Segregated patches of related cooperative cells are able to outcompete
unrelated cells. These dynamics have been explored computationally and

form biofilms, we investigate the interactions of environmental isolates
with different social phenotypes. We find that biofilm strains spatially
exclude nonbiofilm strains and that biofilm spatial structure confers a
consistent and robust fitness advantage in direct competition.
Furthermore, biofilms may protect against killer toxin, a warfare
phenotype. During biofilm formation, cells are susceptible to toxin from
nearby competitors; however, increased spatial use may provide an escape
from toxin producers. Our results suggest that yeast biofilms represent

physical microhabitat characteristics affect species and body size
distribution of fish within a stream riffle segment in a coastal
subtropical drainage of Brazil. Fishes were sampled by electrofishing 56
riffle plots along a 730-m long stream segment. Species composition was
significantly related to four microhabitat characteristics: substrate
size, flow velocity, distance to margin and depth. In addition, mean
body size increased with increasing substrate size and depth of
microhabitat sampling plots. However, when including species identity in
linear mixed-effects models (LMM), we observed a different relationship
between body size and microhabitat characteristics, but most of the
variation was explained by species identity. Thus, we fitted LMMs
separately for each species and found species-specific relations between
intraspecific variation in body size and microhabitat characteristics.
The low variation explained in the models suggests that other fine scale
factors, such as biotic interactions and dispersal from adjacent habitat
patches, should be incorporated in modeling microhabitat use by stream

We found that abundant and rare bacterial taxa were distinctly different

environmental (selective processes) and spatial (neutral processes)

environmental selection; however, the abundant subcommunity had a much
stronger response to spatial factors (17.3% of pure variance was

variation to evaluate the influence of niche- and dispersal-based

clusters. The results showed a significant association between
geographic clusters of lakes based on gradients of climate and landscape

dispersal mechanisms were a major contributor to diatom metacommunity

clusters. In the Andean Altiplano and adjacent lowlands of Bolivia,
diatom metacommunities are niche assembled but constrained by either
dispersal limitation or mass effects, resulting from area, environmental
heterogeneity, and ecological guild relationships. Topographic
heterogeneity played an important role in structuring planktic diatom
metacommunities. We emphasize the value of a guild-based metacommunity
model linked to dispersal for elucidating mechanisms underlying
latitudinal gradients in distribution. Our findings reveal the
importance of shifts in ecological drivers across climatic and
physiographically distinct lake clusters, providing a basis for
comparison of broad-scale community gradients in lake-rich regions
elsewhere. This may help guide future research to explore evolutionary
constraints on the rich Neotropical benthic diatom species pool.},

not clear how it influences species coexistence. Theory predicts that IV
will hinder coexistence but empirical studies have shown that it can
facilitate, inhibit, or have a neutral effect. We use a theoretical
model to explore the consequences of IV on local and regional species
coexistence in the context of spatial environmental structure. Our
results show that individual variation can have a positive effect on
species coexistence and that this effect will critically depend on the
spatial structure of such variation. IV facilitates coexistence when a
negative, concave-up relationship between individuals' competitive
response and population growth rates propagates to a disproportionate
advantage for the inferior competitor, provided that each species
specialises in a habitat. While greater variation in the preferred
habitat generally fosters coexistence, the opposite is true for
non-preferred habitats. Our results reconcile theory with empirical
findings.},

abstract = {African buffalo the primary source of foot and mouth disease (FMD)
infection for livestock in South Africa. Predicting the spatial drivers
and patterns of buffalo-cattle contact risk is crucial for developing
effective FMD mitigation strategies. Therefore, the goal of this study
was to predict fine-scale, seasonal contact risk between cattle and
buffaloes straying into communal lands adjacent to Kruger National Park.
This study provides the first application of the cumulative resistant
kernel method to calculate contact risk between two species. We built
resistance surfaces from resource utilization models of buffalo and
cattle and calculated the intersection of resistant kernels of the two
species. This revealed that the contact risk is influenced by
seasonality, water sources and fence strength, and the magnitude of
contact risk is largely driven by buffalo and cattle dispersal
abilities. The probability of contact was higher in the dry season, with
hotspots along a main river and the weakest parts of the perimeter
fence. In the wet season, contact risk was more diffuse and less
concentrated along the main river and near settlements. The new approach
of intersecting cumulative resistant kernels of two species can produce
quantitative predictive maps of animals' contact risk and help identify
potential hotspots of disease transmission.},

abstract = {1. River networks are hierarchical dendritic habitats embedded within
the terrestrial landscape, with varying connectivity between sites
depending on their positions along the network. This physical
organisation influences the dispersal of organisms, which ultimately
affects metacommunity dynamics and biodiversity patterns.
2. We provide a conceptual synthesis of the role of river networks in
structuring metacommunities in relation to dispersal processes in
riverine ecosystems. We explore where the river network best explains
observed metacommunity structure compared to other measurements of
physical connectivity. We mostly focus on invertebrates, but also
consider other taxonomic groups, including microbes, fishes, plants, and
amphibians.
3. Synthesising studies that compared multiple spatial distance metrics,
we found that the importance of the river network itself in explaining
metacommunity patterns depended on a variety of factors, including
dispersal mode (aquatic versus aerial versus terrestrial) and landscape
type (arid versus mesic), as well as location- specific factors, such as
network connectivity, land use, topographic heterogeneity, and biotic
interactions. The river network appears to be less important for strong
aerial dispersers and insects in arid systems than for other groups and
biomes, but there is considerable variability. Borrowing from other
literature, particularly landscape genetics, we developed a conceptual
model that predicts that the explanatory power of the river network
peaks in mesic systems for obligate aquatic dispersers.
4. We propose directions of future avenues of research, including the
use of manipulative field and laboratory experiments that test
metacommunity theory in river networks. While field and laboratory
experiments have their own benefits and drawbacks (e.g. reality,
control, cost), both are powerful approaches for understanding the
mechanisms structuring metacommunities, by teasing apart dispersal and
niche-related factors.
5. Finally, improving our knowledge of dispersal in river networks will
benefit from expanding the breadth of cost-distance modelling to better
infer dispersal from observational data; an improved understanding of
life-history strategies rather than relying on independent traits;
exploring individual-level variation in dispersal through detailed
genetic studies; detailed studies on fine-scale environmental (e.g.
daily hydrology) and organismal spatiotemporal variability; and
synthesising comparative, experimental, and theoretical work. Expanding
in these areas will help to push the current state of the science from a
largely pattern-detection mode into a new phase of more mechanistically
driven research.},

hydrolyses ATP at the feeding site and thus inhibits platelet
aggregation, and a nitrophorin, which brings nitrous oxide to the
feeding site, inhibiting platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. We
observed more variation at both salivary protein genes among parasite
populations associated with different host species than among
populations from different spatial locations associated with the same
host species. The variation in salivary protein genes among populations
on different host species was also greater than expected under a neutral
scenario of genetic drift and gene flow. Finally, host species was an
important predictor of allelic divergence in genotypes of individual
C.adjunctus at both salivary protein genes. Our results suggest
differing selection pressures on these two salivary protein genes in

availability. Food resource fluctuations, characteristic of seasonal
environments, can be affected by the naturalization of exotic
ornithocorous plants. In the mountain forest of central Argentina,
invasive shrubs of the genus Pyracantha provide a new temporal resource
that modifies fluctuations of natural resource availability because the
invasives fructify in autumn-winter (largely uncoupled with the fruiting
of native species). The contrasting patterns of resource fluctuation
between non-invaded and invaded areas throughout the year provide a good
study system to test predictions of the fruit-tracking hypothesis, and
to understand the relationship between food resources offered by fleshy
fruited invasives and abundances of avian trophic guilds. By means of
point counts conducted during five time periods at invaded and
non-invaded sites we found that the presence of Pyracantha, and time
periods, significantly affected frugivorous bird abundance, which in
autumn-winter was greater in invaded sites and in spring-summer similar
between invaded and non-invaded sites. On the other hand, granivores and
insectivores did not show a significant relationship with the presence
of Pyracantha. Abundances of the most common seed disperser were
significantly affected by the interaction between time period and
presence of Pyracantha. These results indicate that the abundances of
birds that legitimately disperse Pyracantha seeds are temporally and
spatially associated with fruit abundance provided by this exotic plant.
This underscores fruit availability as an important ecological factor
affecting frugivorous bird abundance, and suggests that Pyracantha seed
dispersers are capable of detecting changes in the availability of its
fruit, likely contributing to the effectiveness of its dispersal.},

disturbance features. Such differences in the ecological niches of
genetic clusters should be interpreted in light of neutral processes
that hinder movement, dispersal, and gene flow among the genetic
clusters, in order to not prematurely assume any selective or adaptive
processes. In the present study, we found that both the plasticity of
wolves-a habitat generalist-to cope with different environmental

relative influence of habitat, major prey, disturbance and management on

the environment determines bird movements and thus affects seed
dispersal. We used inverse modeling to analyze bird-mediated dispersal

crop-fields. We assessed the effects of egestion mode (regurgitation and
defecation) and tree density (as an environment character) on seed
dispersal. Seed dispersal presented different spatial patterns depending
on the egestion mode. Tree density was positively associated with the
number of regurgitated dispersed seeds and negatively associated with
the number of defecated dispersed seeds. In both cases, dispersal
distance increased in open areas, but absence of perches inhibited seed
arrival. Thus, spread of L. lucidum is facilitated in open areas with
some trees; inside the native forest, short distance dispersal
facilitates the gradual invasion by this exotic species. Our results
suggest that processes like crop abandonment and forest succession,
which are active in subtropical montane systems, may facilitate L.

actual distribution maps of L. lucidum to identify areas vulnerable to

abstract = {1. Metacommunity theory focuses on assembly patterns in ecological
communities, originally exemplified through four different, yet
non-exclusive, perspectives: patch dynamics, species sorting,
source-sink dynamics, and neutral theory. More recently, three exclusive
components have been proposed to describe a different metacommunity
framework: habitat heterogeneity, species equivalence, and dispersal.
Here, we aim at evaluating the insect metacommunity of a subarctic
stream network under these two different frameworks.
2. We first modelled the presence/absence of 47 stream insects in
northernmost Finland, using binomial generalised linear models (GLMs).
The deviance explained by pure local environmental (E), spatial (S), and
climatic variables (C) was then analysed across species using beta
regression. In this comparative analysis, site occupancy, as well as
taxonomic and biological trait vectors obtained from principal
coordinate analysis, were used as predictor variables.
3. Single-species distributions were better explained by in-stream
environmental and spatial factors than by climatic forcing, but in a
highly variable fashion. This variability was difficult to relate to the
taxonomic relatedness among species or their biological trait
similarity. Site occupancy, however, was related to model performance of
the binomial GLMs based on spatial effects: as populations are likely to
be better connected for common species due to their near ubiquity,
spatial factors may also explain better their distributions.
4. According to the classical four-perspective framework, the
observation of both environmental and spatial effects suggests a role
for either mass effects or species sorting constrained by dispersal
limitation, or both. Taxonomic and biological traits, including the
different dispersal capability of species, were scarcely important,
which undermines the patch dynamics perspective, based on differences in
dispersal ability between species. The highly variable performance of
models makes the reliance on an entirely neutral framework unrealistic
as well. According to the three-component framework, our results suggest
that the stream insect metacommunity is shaped by the effect of habitat
heterogeneity (supporting both species-sorting and mass effects), rather
than species equivalence or dispersal limitation.
5. While the relative importance of the source-sink dynamics perspective
or the species-sorting paradigm cannot be deciphered with the data at
our disposal, we can conclude that habitat heterogeneity is an important
driver shaping species distributions and insect assemblages in subarctic
stream metacommunities. These results exemplify that the use of the
three-component metacommunity framework may be more useful than the
classical four perspective paradigm in analysing metacommunities. Our
findings also provide support for conservation strategies based on the
preservation of heterogeneous habitats in a metacommunity context.},

lakes of the Yangtze River catchment in China in the spring and summer

turnover in phytoplankton. The results showed that 1) the two-season
temporal turnover of phytoplankton varied based on the mean values and
the coefficient of variance of environmental variables, and pH was the
most important variable negatively affecting the temporal turnover; 2)
the spatial beta diversity of phytoplankton in summer was higher than
that in spring, and the distance decay pattern was significant in
summer, but not in spring; 3) the variation in spatial turnover in
spring and summer was attributed to the primary environmental variables
(nitrogen, phosphorus and underwater available light) and broader-scale
spatial variables; 4) the proportion of jointly explained variation of
spatial Bray-Curtis dissimilarity by the environment and space increased
from similar to 38% (spring) to similar to 55% (summer), which was
mainly due to the variation in spatially structured environmental
variables during the two-season temporal turnover, such as pH and ion
concentrations; 5) the community compositions in summer were more
similar between the lakes with similar two-season temporal turnover.
These results indicate that the spatial turnover of phytoplankton
composition in summer was partially predetermined by the variation in
environmental variables and phytoplankton composition during the process

temporal variations in spatial beta diversity as well as the underlying
assembly mechanisms in phytoplankton.},

composition was associated with climatic gradients or geographical
distance. Turnover (dissimilarity) in species composition of different
islands or among more distant sites would suggest communities structured
by speciation and dispersal limitations. A nested pattern would be
consistent with a steep resource gradient. Correlation of species
composition with climatic variation would suggest communities structured
by broad-scale environmental filtering.
Location: The West Indies (The Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica,
Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Lucia),
Providencia (Colombia), south Florida (USA) and Florida Keys (USA).
Taxon: Seed plants-woody taxa (primarily trees).
Methods: We compiled 572 plots from 23 surveys conducted between 1969
and 2016. Hierarchical clustering of species in plots, and indicator
species analysis for the resulting groups of sites, identified
geographical patterns of turnover in species composition. Nonparametric
analysis of variance, applied to principal components of bioclimatic
variables, determined the degree of covariation in climate with
location. Nestedness versus turnover in species composition was
evaluated using beta diversity partitioning. Generalized dissimilarity
modelling partitioned the effect of climate versus geographical distance
on species composition.
Results: Despite a set of commonly occurring species, SDTF tree
community composition was distinct among islands and was characterized
by spatial turnover on climatic gradients that covaried with
geographical gradients. Greater Antillean islands were characterized by
endemic indicator species. Northern subtropical areas supported
distinct, rather than nested, SDTF communities in spite of low levels of
endemism.
Main conclusions: The SDTF species composition was correlated with
climatic variation. SDTF on large Greater Antillean islands (Hispaniola,
Jamaica and Cuba) was characterized by endemic species, consistent with
their geological history and the biogeography of plant lineages. These
results suggest that both environmental filtering and speciation shape

Microsatellite loci were used to investigate the pollen and seed dispersal, mating patterns, spatial genetic structure (SGS), genetic diversity, and inbreeding depression in H.stigonocarpa adults, juveniles, and open-pollinated seeds, which were sampled from isolated trees in a pasture and trees within a forest fragment in the Brazilian savannah. We found that the species presented a mixed mating system, with population and individual variations in the outcrossing rate (0.53-1.0). The studied populations were not genetically isolated due to pollen and seed flow between the studied populations and between the populations and individuals located outside of the study area. Pollen and seed dispersal occurred over long distances (>8km); however, the dispersal patterns were isolated by distance, with a high frequency of mating occurring between near-neighbor trees and seeds dispersed near the parent trees. The correlated mating for individual seed trees was higher within than among fruits, indicating that fruits present a high proportion of full-sibs. Genetic diversity and SGS were similar among the populations, but offspring showed evidence of inbreeding, mainly originating from mating among related trees, which suggests inbreeding depression between the seed and adult stages. Selfing resulted in a higher inbreeding depression than mating among relatives, as assessed through survival and height. As the populations are not genetically isolated, both are important targets for in situ conservation to maintain their genetic diversity; for ex situ conservation, seeds can be collected from at least 78 trees in both populations separated by at least 250m.},

abstract = {Lethal carnivore management is a prevailing strategy to reduce livestock
predation. Intensity of lethal management varies according to land-use,
where carnivores are more intensively hunted on farms relative to
reserves. Variations in hunting intensity may result in the formation of
a source-sink system where carnivores disperse from high-density to
low-density areas. Few studies quantify dispersal between supposed
sources and sinks-a fundamental requirement for source-sink systems. We
used the black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) as a model to determine
if heterogeneous anthropogenic mortality induces a source-sink system.
We analysed 12 microsatellite loci from 554 individuals from lightly
hunted and previously unhunted reserves, as well as heavily hunted
livestock- and game farms. Bayesian genotype assignment showed that
jackal populations displayed a hierarchical population structure. We
identified two genetically distinct populations at the regional level
and nine distinct subpopulations at the local level, with each cluster
corresponding to distinct land-use types separated by various dispersal
barriers. Migration, estimated using Bayesian multilocus genotyping,
between reserves and farms was asymmetric and heterogeneous
anthropogenic mortality induced source-sink dynamics via compensatory
immigration. Additionally some heavily hunted populations also acted as
source populations, exporting individuals to other heavily hunted
populations. This indicates that heterogeneous anthropogenic mortality
results in the formation of a complex series of interconnected sources
and sinks. Thus, lethal management of mesopredators may not be an
effective long-term strategy in reducing livestock predation, as
dispersal and, more importantly, compensatory immigration may continue
to affect population reduction efforts as long as dispersal from other
areas persists.},

abstract = {Dispersal and density dependence are major determinants of spatial
structure, population dynamics and coexistence for tropical forest
plants. However, because these two processes can jointly influence
spatial structure at similar scales, analysing spatial patterns to
separate and quantify them is often difficult.
Species functional traits can be useful indicators of dispersal and
density dependence. However, few methods exist for linking functional
traits to quantitative estimates of these processes that can be compared
across multiple species.
We analysed static spatial patterns of woody plant populations in the
50ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama with methods
that distinguished scale-specific differences in species aggregation. We
then tested how these differences related to seven functional traits:
growth form, dispersal syndrome, tree canopy layer, adult stature, seed
mass, wood density and shade tolerance. Next, we fit analytically
tractable spatial moment models to the observed spatial structure of
species characterized by similar trait values, which allowed us to
estimate relationships of functional traits with the spatial scale of
dispersal, and the spatial scale and intensity of negative density
dependence.
Our results confirm that lianas are more aggregated than trees, and
exhibit increased aggregation within canopy gaps. For trees, increased
seed mass, wood density and shade tolerance were associated with less
intense negative density dependence, while higher canopy layers and
increased stature were associated with decreased aggregation and better
dispersal. Spatial structure for trees was also strongly determined by
dispersal syndrome. Averaged across all spatial scales, zoochory was
more effective than wind dispersal, which was more effective than
explosive dispersal. However, at intermediate scales, zoochory was
associated with more aggregation than wind dispersal, potentially
because of differences in short-distance dispersal and the intensity of
negative density dependence.
Synthesis. We develop new tools for identifying significant associations
between functional traits and spatial structure, and for linking these
associations to quantitative estimates of dispersal scale and the
strength and scale of density dependence. Our results help clarify how
these processes influence woody plant species on Barro Colorado, and
demonstrate how these tools can be applied to other sites and systems},

restoration, because it offers a cost-effective solution compared to
technical reclamation methods. This topic is especially important
nowadays, as large areas of marginal croplands are being abandoned on
poor soils of Central and Eastern Europe, which offers a possibility for
the spontaneous recovery of typical target grasslands. Studying the
vegetation composition, aboveground biomass, and seed bank in old fields
of different age and target calcareous sand grasslands using the
chronosequence method, we aimed to answer the following questions: (1)
Which species contribute to the seed banks of old fields and reference
grasslands? (2) Does the direction of vegetation and seed bank
succession trend toward the reference grasslands? (3) How are the
vegetation changes in spontaneous succession reflected by the soil seed
banks of old fields? In reference grasslands on the dune tops only
sporadic seed banks were detected, while several hygrophytes had dense
seed banks in reference grasslands in dune slacks. Similarity between
the species composition of vegetation and seed banks was low. The
development of vegetation and seed banks in old fields progressed toward
that of target grasslands and the proportion of weedy species (e.g.
indigenous weeds and invasive species) also decreased with time. The
cryptogam biomass correlated significantly negatively, while the soil
phosphorus significantly positively with the weedy species seed bank
density. Our results indicated that the role of persistent seed banks in
the regeneration of calcareous sand grasslands from old fields is rather
limited and promising vegetation changes are mostly driven by spatial
dispersal.},

abstract = {Meiofauna play an important ecological role in benthic ecosystems. However, little is known about their small-scale (<1m(2)) distribution. Yet, this knowledge has both theoretical implications, by improving our understanding of how processes generate patterns; and practical outcomes by improving sampling designs. The goal of this study was to obtain insights into the small-scale distribution of meiofaunal invertebrates dwelling in the sediment of a lentic ecosystem (in this study, an artificial pond). We addressed this aim at coarse and fine taxonomical levels using meiofaunal groups and nematode species assemblages, respectively. For this purpose, 225 sediment samples were collected over a surface of 729cm(2) using a straw corer. Spatial patterns (dispersion index) and the typical patch sizes of the dominant meiofaunal groups were estimated using spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran's I). We hypothesized that (1) we would find a patchy distribution of organisms with patch radii of a few centimetres, (2) the distribution of microbivorous meiofauna would follow that of OM, and (3) distribution would be patchier at the species level. The densities of the dominant meiobenthic groups (nematodes, gastrotrichs and rotifers) decreased with sediment depth. In all sediment layers, nematodes contributed 61%-82% to total invertebrate densities. Eleven nematode species were identified, with Eumonhystera filiformis (Bastian 1865) and Monhystera cf. paludicola de Man 1881 dominating the assemblage. All meiofaunal groups showed an aggregated distribution pattern (dispersion index >1). Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed aggregations of nematodes in a patch radius of 3-8cm according to the different sediment layers. Rotifers were also patchy distributed but with smaller patch radius (3cm), whereas the respective distributions of gastrotrichs were less patchy. Therefore, our results mainly confirmed hypothesis (1). Our results provide the first insights into rotifer patch sizes. Also, these findings highlight the need for sampling designs better able to capture small-scale heterogeneities during larger-scale investigations. We ruled out the organic matter (OM) supply as an important driver of meiofaunal community structure as OM content did not correlate with the density of either meiofaunal groups or nematode species, and therefore arguing against hypothesis (2). Instead, the different distributions suggested responses to qualitative differences in resource availability, oxygen availability, biotic interactions and specific population-level processes, such as behaviour, dispersal and locomotion. Patchiness did not increase from coarse to fine taxonomic levels, thus contradicting hypothesis (3). Our results instead suggest that the patchiness of the spatial distribution was more closely linked to functional traits.},

explanation for what drives it continues to be debated. Previous efforts
have focused on a subset of potential drivers, including evolutionary
rate, evolutionary time (maximum clade age of species restricted to a
region), dispersal (migration from one region to another), ecological
factors and climatic stability. However, no study has evaluated these
competing hypotheses simultaneously at a broad spatial scale. Here, we
examine their relative contribution in determining the richness of the
most comprehensive dataset of tetrapods to our knowledge (84% of the
described species), distinguishing between the direct influences of
evolutionary rate, evolutionary time and dispersal, and the indirect
influences of ecological factors and climatic stability through their
effect on direct factors. We found that evolutionary time exerted a
primary influence on species richness, with evolutionary rate being of
secondary importance. By contrast, dispersal did not significantly
affect richness patterns. Ecological and climatic stability factors
influenced species richness indirectly by modifying evolutionary time
(i.e. persistence time) and rate. Overall, our findings suggest that
global heterogeneity in tetrapod richness is explained primarily by the
length of time species have had to diversify.},

abstract = {Understanding how variation in hosts, parasites, and the environment
shapes patterns of disease is key to predicting ecological and
evolutionary outcomes of epidemics. Yet in spatially structured
populations, variation in host resistance may be spatially confounded
with variation in parasite dispersal and environmental factors that
affect disease processes. To tease apart these disease drivers, we
paired surveys of natural epidemics with experiments manipulating
spatial variation in host susceptibility to infection. We mapped
epidemics of the wind-dispersed powdery mildew pathogen Podosphaera
plantaginis in five populations of its plant host, Plantago lanceolata.
At 15 replicate sites within each population, we deployed groups of
healthy potted `sentinel' plants from five allopatric host lines. By
tracking which sentinels became infected in the field and measuring
pathogen connectivity and microclimate at those sites, we could test how
variation in these factors affected disease when spatial variation in
host resistance and soil conditions was minimized. We found that the
prevalence and severity of sentinel infection varied over small spatial
scales in the field populations, largely due to heterogeneity in
pathogen prevalence on wild plants and unmeasured environmental factors.
Microclimate was critical for disease spread only at the onset of
epidemics, where humidity increased infection risk. Sentinels were more
likely to become infected than initially healthy wild plants at a given
field site. However, in a follow-up laboratory inoculation study we
detected no significant differences between wild and sentinel plant
lines in their qualitative susceptibility to pathogen isolates from the
field populations, suggesting that primarily non-genetic differences
between sentinel and wild hosts drove their differential infection rates
in the field. Our study leverages a multi-faceted experimental approach
to disentangle important biotic and abiotic drivers of disease patterns
within wild populations.},

abstract = {Aim: When modelling the distribution of animals under current and future
conditions, both their response to environmental constraints and their
resources' response to these environmental constraints need to be taken
into account. Here, we develop a framework to predict the distribution
of large herbivores under global change, while accounting for changes in
their main resources. We applied it to Rupicapra rupicapra, the chamois
of the European Alps.
Location: The Bauges Regional Park (French Alps).
Methods: We built sixteen plant functional groups (PFGs) that account
for the chamois' diet (estimated from sequenced environmental DNA found
in the faeces), climatic requirements, dispersal limitations,
successional stage and interaction for light. These PFGs were then
simulated using a dynamic vegetation model, under current and future
climatic conditions up to 2100. Finally, we modelled the spatial
distribution of the chamois under both current and future conditions
using a point-process model applied to either climate-only variables or
climate and simulated vegetation structure variables.
Results: Both the climate-only and the climate and vegetation models
successfully predicted the current distribution of the chamois species.
However, when applied into the future, the predictions differed widely.
While the climate-only models predicted an 80% decrease in total
species occupancy, including vegetation structure and plant resources
for chamois in the model provided more optimistic predictions because
they account for the transient dynamics of the vegetation (-20% in
species occupancy).
Main conclusions: Applying our framework to the chamois shows that the
inclusion of ecological mechanisms (i.e., plant resources) produces more
realistic predictions under current conditions and should prove useful
for anticipating future impacts. We have shown that discounting the pure
effects of vegetation on chamois might lead to over-pessimistic
predictions under climate change. Our approach paves the way for
improved synergies between different fields to produce biodiversity
scenarios.},

Using this method, we estimated the dispersal ability of 50 co-occurring grassland species using the Wald Analytical Long-distance Dispersal (WALD) model. Grassland plants species are often used for developing community theory, yet species-level estimates of their dispersal abilities are comparatively rare. We use these dispersal measurements to examine the relationship between species dispersal abilities and successional dynamics using data from a 90-yr old field chronosequence. We find that our estimated dispersal measurements matched field-based establishment observations well, and estimated species colonization, competitive, and establishment abilities. We hope that this method for measuring dispersal ability of multiple species within a community, and its demonstrated ability to generate predictions for spatial ecology, will encourage more studies of the explicit role of dispersal in plant community ecology.},

is a key determinant of the impacts of biological invasions and the
efficacy of importation biological control programs. Understanding which
life-history traits or abiotic factors moderate spread rates is
important for designing trapping and eradication programs for invasive
insects and for designing release protocols of imported natural enemies.
Our aim was to identify variables that can explain variation in spread
rates of introduced insects.
Location: Global. Spread rates from 30 different countries were
compiled.
Time period: 1976-2014.
Major taxon studied: Insecta.
Methods: We compiled 147 published spread rates of 86 non-native
insects. Spread rates were averaged per species so that each insect was
only represented once in statistical analyses. Simultaneously, we
collected information on several variables associated with the
introduced insects such as adult longevity, diet breadth, diet
preference, eusociality, fecundity, taxonomic order, role of passive
dispersal (important versus not important), size, type (invasive species
versus biological control agent), voltinism (i.e., the number of
generations per year) and duration of spread. In addition to analysis of
the complete data set, analyses of several subsets of the data were
conducted to determine robustness and sensitivity of findings.
Results: In the global analysis, voltinism was clearly the most
significant predictor of spread rates. Insects with more than one
generation per year spread faster than those with one or fewer
generations. Analyses limited to either invasive species or importation
biological agents further confirmed that multivoltine insects spread
faster on average than univoltine insects.
Main conclusions: Whereas previous work has shown that accidentally
introduced insects spread faster than those introduced intentionally,
the identification of voltinism as a key predictor of spread may enhance
risk analyses and accuracy of forecasting, especially where a changing
climate may alter patterns of voltinism.},

correlations in environmental drivers as well as synchrony induced by
individual dispersal. Many statistical analyses of populations ignore
potential autocorrelations and assume that survey methods (distance and
time between samples) eliminate these correlations, allowing samples to
be treated independently. If these assumptions are incorrect, results
and therefore inference may be biased and uncertainty underestimated. We
developed a novel statistical method to account for spatiotemporal
correlations within dendritic stream networks, while accounting for
imperfect detection in the surveys. Through simulations, we found this
model decreased predictive error relative to standard statistical
methods when data were spatially correlated based on stream distance and
performed similarly when data were not correlated. We found that
increasing the number of years surveyed substantially improved the model
accuracy when estimating spatial and temporal correlation coefficients,

the network improved the performance of the nonspatial model but only
marginally improved the density estimates in the spatiotemporal model.
We applied this model to brook trout data from the West Susquehanna

found the model including temporal and spatiotemporal autocorrelation
best described young of the year (YOY) and adult density patterns. YOY

limiting similarity' or `habitat filtering', respectively - predict
contrasting patterns in the spatial arrangement of functional traits.
Previous analyses have made progress in testing these predictions and
identifying underlying processes, but have also pointed to theoretical
as well as methodological shortcomings. Here we applied a recently
developed methodology for spatially explicit analysis of phylogenetic
meta-community structure to study the pattern of co-occurrence of
functional traits in Afrotropical and Neotropical bird species
inhabiting forest fragments. Focusing separately on locomotory, dietary,
and dispersal traits, we tested whether environmental filtering causes
spatial clustering, or competition leads to spatial segregation as
predicted by limiting similarity theory. We detected significant
segregation of species co-occurrences in African fragments, but not in
the Neotropical ones. Interspecific competition had a higher impact on
trait co-occurrence than filter effects, yet no single functional trait
was able to explain the observed degree of spatial segregation among
species. Despite high regional variability spanning from spatial
segregation to aggregation, we found a consistent tendency for a
clustered spatial patterning of functional traits among communities in
fragmented landscapes, particularly in non-territorial species. Overall,
we show that behavioural effects, such as territoriality, and
environmental effects, such as the area of forest remnants or properties
of the landscape matrix in which they are embedded, can strongly affect
the pattern of trait co-occurrence. Our findings suggest that
trait-based analyses of community structure should include behavioural
and environmental covariates, and we here provide an appropriate method
for linking functional traits, species ecology and environmental

abstract = {Little is known about the movements and behavior of neonate eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina). We investigated spatial ecology of neonate eastern box turtles at 4 upland openings in the Manistee National Forest, Michigan, USA, 2012-2016. We protected nests and used radio-telemetry to document dispersal from nests, land cover types used for overwintering, and residency time of neonates in natal openings. We used binomial logistic regression to model probabilities of overwintering in natal openings versus adjacent forest and edge. We protected 64 nests, radio-fitted 64 neonates over 4 cohort years, tracked 46 neonates from nest emergence to their overwintering sites, and tracked 28 neonates for portions of their second activity season. Dispersal (straight-line distance from nest to overwintering site) was limited in the first activity season (n=46 neonates, (x) over bar =19.92.4m {[}SE], range=1.9-83.2m) and 24 overwintered in natal openings, 4 overwintered in the forest edge, and 18 overwintered in forest. Our best logistic model included the predictor variables distance from nest to nearest forest edge and day of nest emergence. Probability of overwintering within a natal opening was greater for neonates from nests located farther from the forest edge and for neonates emerging from nests later in the year.

abstract = {Changes in the spatial density and availability of resources offered by
plants due to habitat fragmentation and overexploitation of the natural
environment are likely to affect mutualistic interactions. We tested
whether changes in the density of neighborhood conspecific and
heterospecific plants and in the availability of resources influence the
frequency and composition of floral and frugivorous visitors of eleven
individuals of the same population of the threatened palm Euterpe edulis
in Brazil. The frequency of floral visitors was positively associated
with conspecific density and availability of resources. Species
composition was affected by the availability of resources since some bee
species were associated with palms that offered more flowers, whereas
others were associated with palms that offered less. Two bee species may
be able to mediate long-distance pollen-flow for E. edulis: an
undetermined species of Euglossini and Apis mellifera. Frugivorous birds
were not influenced by any of the factors investigated. Birds of the
genus Turdus predominated in the assemblage and were responsible for
most of the interactions. This is probably due to the fact that, unlike
larger birds, species of Turdus are considered resilient to
environmental disturbances. Due to the continuous defaunation and
fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest, the number of large birds that can
promote long-distance seed dispersal is declining, with implications for
the genetic diversity of E. edulis. Measures to restore the population
density of E. edulis will likely favor the recovery of its genetic
diversity due to its high capacity for distant pollen dispersal.
Recovering and protecting large frugivorous birds may also contribute to
the maintenance of the population density and genetic diversity of E.
edulis.},

populations will depend on their ability to colonize habitat newly
suitable for their climatic requirements. Opportunities for such range

climate change are identified and protected from land uses that impede
movement. While many climate adaptation strategies focus on identifying
refugia, this study is the first to characterize areas which merit
protection for their role in promoting climate connectivity at a
continental extent. We identified climate connectivity areas across
North America by delineating paths between current climate types and
their future analogs that avoided nonanalogous climates, and used
centrality metrics to rank the contribution of each location to
facilitating dispersal across the landscape. The distribution of
connectivity areas was influenced by climatic and topographic factors at
multiple spatial scales. Results were robust to uncertainty in the
magnitude of future climate change arising from differing emissions
scenarios and general circulation models, but sensitive to analysis
extent and assumptions concerning dispersal behavior and maximum
dispersal distance. Paths were funneled along north-south trending
passes and valley systems and away from areas of novel and disappearing
climates. Climate connectivity areas, where many potential dispersal
paths overlapped, were distinct from refugia and thus poorly captured by
many existing conservation strategies. Existing protected areas with
high connectivity values were found in southern Mexico, the southwestern
US, and western and arctic Canada and Alaska. Ecoregions within the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Great Plains, eastern temperate forests, high

abstract = {Understanding metacommunity organisation in freshwater ecosystems is
particularly important at high elevation in the tropical Andes, as this
region is considered an important biodiversity hotspot with many endemic
species threatened by climate change. High levels of dispersal at the
regional scale and strong environmental filters at the local scale are
thought to structure aquatic communities in these systems. However,
metacommunity organisation patterns at the limit of aquatic life
(>4,500ma.s.l.) remain largely unknown. Given the extreme environmental
conditions experienced by organisms at high elevation, environment
filters would be expected to play a greater role than spatial filters in
community assemblages. We assessed the effects of environmental and
spatial filters on zooplankton (Cladocera), to gain insight into
metacommunity organisation in the shallow high-elevation pools of the
tropical Andes. We sampled zooplankton communities and assessed nine
environmental variables, for 200 pools from 20 peatlands in the
Cordillera Real of Bolivia. We performed redundancy and variation
partitioning analyses on both abundance and presence/absence data, to
evaluate the contribution of environmental and spatial processes
(geographic and elevation distances) to cladoceran metacommunity
assembly at different spatial scales. We identified 18 cladoceran
species, eight of which were endemic to the Andes. We found that both
environment and spatial filters made a significant contribution to the
structuring of cladoceran communities at higher spatial scales (i.e.
intervalleys and within valleys), whereas only the environmental filter
operated at small spatial scales (i.e. within peatlands). Elevation had
a significant effect on cladoceran community variation (e.g. 6.9%
within valleys, for abundance data), but not on species diversity.
Similar patterns were obtained with presence/absence data. Macrophyte
cover, pool area and pH were the most important variables explaining
community variation and the species diversity of cladocerans at pool
level. These results suggest that species sorting is probably the main
process generating variation in cladoceran communities at all spatial
scales. At larger spatial scales (intervalleys and within valleys),
limited dispersal may also filter species composition. We identified
factors significantly contributing to the variation observed, but their
overall explanatory power was low. This finding highlights the
difficulties involved in evaluating the response of aquatic organisms to
their environment and suggests that other environmental variables should
be considered. Moreover, frequent and unpredictable disturbances and
high stochasticity probably operate simultaneously with environmental
filters to structure zooplankton organisation in these unique and harsh
aquatic systems.},

we also show several striking discrepancies. Among the most interesting
are the evolution of different degrees of host specificity in closely
related louse lineages in sympatry, or decoupled population structures
of the host and parasites in central Europe. We also find strong support
for the prediction that parasites with narrower host specificity possess
a lower level of genetic diversity and a deeper pattern of
interpopulation structure as a result of limited dispersal and smaller
effective population size.},

Estimating dispersal from occupancy data is further complicated by imperfect detection and the presence of unsurveyed patches. 2 We compared dispersal distances inferred from seven years of occupancy data for 212 wetlands in a metapopulation of the secretive and threatened California black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus) to distances between parent-offspring dyads identified with 16 microsatellites. 3 We used a novel autoregressive multi-season occupancy model that accounted for both unsurveyed patches and imperfect detection to quantify patch isolation using buffer radius (BRM) and incidence function (IFM) connectivity measures at 15 scales (1-10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 km). Connectivity measures were then fit as colonization covariates in occupancy models to estimate a model-averaged dispersal distance. 4 As predicted, colonization was more strongly related to connectivity at small spatial scales (< 10 km). AIC weights were greatest at 7 km for BRM and at 4 km for IFM. 5 Model-averaged dispersal distances (BRM = 7.46 km; IFM = 5.48 km) showed good agreement with the mean M(+/- SE) dispersal distance from 23 parent-offspring dyads (5.58 +/- 1.92 km), indicating reasonably accurate mean dispersal distances can be inferred from occupancy data when isolation strongly affects colonization.},

Pteropus seychellensis comorensis. At a broad scale, we assessed the
ecological niche and habitat suitability for both species using the
Species Distribution Modeling method based on the recent ensembles of
small models (ESM) approach. At a fine scale, Ecological Niche Factor
Analysis (ENFA) was applied to assess habitat selection by each species.
Direct observation was used at each roost to estimate the total number
of individuals and to identify the roost characteristics. At both broad
and fine scales, the analyses highlighted clear niche partitioning by
the two species. We found that P. livingstonii has a very limited
distribution, restricted to steep, high-elevation slopes of the islands'
remaining natural forests, and the patterns were the same for roosting,
foraging sites and the entire habitat. By contrast, P. s. comorensis has
a relatively large geographic range that extends over low-elevation
farmlands and villages and it was negatively correlated to natural
forest across the entire area and all roosting sites, but its foraging
areas were positively correlated to natural forest and high elevation
areas. Both species selected large, tall trees for roosting. The total
number of individuals in the studied area was estimated to be 1243 P.
livingstonii and 11,898 P. s. comorensis. The results of our study
demonstrated that these two species use different habitat types and
ensure different ecosystem services in pollination and seed dispersion
and thus are both critical for maintaining overall ecosystem dynamics.
However, the currently high level of hunting pressure and roost
disturbance makes them vulnerable to extinction. To ensure the viability
of both species, conservation measures need to be taken by the Comoros

these studies have taken place in tropical ecosystems that experience an
inordinate rate of invasions into native habitats. Here, we examined the
effects of plant invasions dominated by non-native tree species on the

we sampled soil in paired native and invaded sites from three watersheds

Whether our analyses considered phylogenetic relatedness or not, we
found that invasions consistently increased the richness of AM fungi.
However, AM fungal species composition was not related to invasion
status of the vegetation nor local environment, but stratified by
watershed. Our results suggest that while invasions can lead to an
overall increase in the diversity of microbial mutualists, the effects
of plant host identity or geographic structuring potentially outweigh
those of invasive species in determining the community membership of AM
fungi. Thus, host specificity and spatial factors such as dispersal need
to be taken into consideration when examining the effects of biological

of deterministic and dispersal limitation mechanisms to odonate
assemblages and distinct patterns of beta diversity between suborders

Our results supported our hypothesis that changes in the composition of

in influencing variation in species composition of tropical woody plants

LocationTropical evergreen forests, Western Ghats, South India.
MethodsUsing a plot-based species inventory spanning the entire
latitudinal extent (1,200km) of the Western Ghats' wet evergreen
forests, we collected primary data on spatial variation in species
composition of woody plants. Each plot was characterized by a set of
environmental descriptors consisting of topographic, edaphic and
climatic variables, while eigenvector-based spatial variables and plot
coordinates were used as spatial descriptors. We used ordination-based
as well as distance-based variation partitioning techniques to partition
the variation in species composition into components uniquely and
jointly explained by environmental and spatial factors.
ResultsThe compositional similarity of woody plants largely showed a
linear decline with log-geographic distance. However, this relationship
was spatially structured. After controlling for the differences in
environment, compositional similarity was found to be strongly
associated with geographic distance only at the smallest spatial scale.
Variation partitioning analysis revealed that environmental variables
explained a much larger proportion of variation in species composition
overall compared to spatial variables. Among environmental variables,
climatic variables emerged as the most important predictors of variation
in species composition at regional and landscape scales.
ConclusionsStrong association between compositional similarity and
geographic distance at local scales indicates the influence of dispersal
limitation, while niche differentiation seems to be a more important
driver of variation in species composition at larger spatial scales.
Overall, our results provide evidence for scale-dependent shifts in the
relative importance of factors that are responsible for variation in

the tractability of artificial systems has led ecologists to praise the
qualities of natural micro- and mesocosms as an ideal means for
investigating the processes that organise biological communities. Among
the different types of naturally occurring micro- and mesocosms,
clusters of rock pools combine a global distribution with the
simplicity, replicability, tractability and structural homogeneity that
are desirable in model experimental systems. However, critical
geographical data gaps in the study of rock pools must be filled if
ecologists are to use these as global model systems in community
ecology. In a year-long study of a cluster of 181 rock pools in the
Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil, we conducted the first study on the
ecology of freshwater rock pool communities in the entire Neotropical
region, to the best of our knowledge. Building on published descriptions
of the factors that drive community assembly within rock pools, we
tested the hypotheses (1) that the effects of environmental factors
prevail over those of spatial factors and (2) that pool volume and
secondarily species interactions between consumers (anuran larvae),
resources (leaf litter) and predators (dragonfly larvae) have a dominant
role in driving species patterns of occurrence and abundance. Our
hypotheses were generally supported as community structure was clearly
influenced by the environmental characteristics of individual pools, and
not to the spatial relations among them. Pool volume had a consistent,
positive influence on the probability of occurrence of dragonflies and
tadpoles of three anuran species, possibly through the influence of
volume on hydroperiod. However, the species most strongly associated
with larger pools were not those with longer times until metamorphosis,
but those with larger egg clutches. In addition, species occurrences
were positively associated with resource availability as measured by
leaf litter mass (significantly so for Rhinella and dragonflies). These
observations suggest that within these severely confined freshwater
systems, indicators of environmental stability and reduced intraspecific
competition could be important ultimate criteria for oviposition site
selection. The ease of sampling and manipulating the rock pools at our
Atlantic Forest site combined with the observation that these pools are
governed by some of the same factors influencing community organisation
in other rock pool systems around the world reinforces the merit of the
system as a means to conduct global comparative studies of the ecology

Bertholletia excelsa (Lecythidaceae) is pollinated by large-bodied bees, while previous seed-tracking experiments suggest their seeds are mainly dispersed across very short distances by scatter-hoarding rodents, who primarily act as seed predators. Here we used parentage analysis to provide contemporary estimates of pollen and seed dispersal in B. excelsa recruits. We examined six 25-ha plots located in two natural stands in the Acre River valley, in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We used 11 microsatellite markers to estimate genetic diversity and fixation index parameters in adults, seedlings and saplings. Genetic diversity was moderate and did not differ across size classes or sampling locations. We assigned pollen and seed parents for < 20% of the recruits, indicating that most events of realized gene flow occurred beyond our 25-ha plots. Only 10 parentage assignments were confirmed with 80% confidence. Pollen distance ranged from 33 to 372 m and seed dispersal from 58 to 655 m. Actual seed-dispersal distances were far greater than the estimates obtained in previous seed-tracking experiments. Thus, studies encompassing larger sampling areas are necessary to determine a more representative spatial scale of B. excelsa's pollen and seed dispersal capacity in natural stands.},

surface area showed a strong positive correlation with population size.
None of these patterns emerged in an earlier study of the same system
using microsatellite loci, and we determined that at least 300-400 SNPs
were needed to recover the fine-scale population structure present in
this system. Conservation assessments using earlier genetic techniques
in other species may similarly lack the statistical power for
small-scale inferences and benefit from reassessments using genomic
tools.},

abstract = {Investigating habitat use and preferences of a threatened species can be challenging, especially if wild populations have decreased to such low numbers that they occupy only fractions of their former natural range. Hence, assessing habitat suitability of a potential release site for a threatened species before a reintroduction attempt can be difficult because frequently no comparable baseline data are available. In these instances, post-release monitoring data can inform about habitat use and preferences of a reintroduced species. Here, we use monitoring data of an endangered endemic island bird, the Chatham Island black robin Petroica traversi, to investigate habitat preferences and the temporal change in distribution patterns across 26years following a reintroduction. We show that densities and distribution of black robin pairs at the reintroduction site have changed significantly over the years. Spatial distribution of pairs is clustered, and this clustering has intensified as the population increased. We used the maximum entropy method MaxEnt to model habitat suitability on the island, showing that black robins clearly prefer forested areas inland that are within 70m to the forest edge at lower elevations (<40m a.s.l.) and on slopes that have a N-NE aspect. The model also identified one area on the island that comprises suitable habitat, but is currently uninhabited. Applying maximum observed densities to the available area of each suitability class, carrying capacity is estimated as 170 nesting pairs across the island, highlighting the need to find further appropriate habitat urgently. Overall, these topographical and habitat preferences considerably restrict this species' potential distribution, a constraint that has serious conservation implications for future population growth of current populations and (re)introductions to new locations. This study demonstrates that post-release data can reveal relevant limitations to habitat use of highly threatened species.},

abstract = {Organisms commonly experience significant spatiotemporal variation in
their environments. In response to such heterogeneity, different
mechanisms may act that enhance ecological performance locally. However,
depending on the nature of the mechanism involved, the consequences for
populations may differ greatly. Building on a previous model that
investigated the conditions under which different adaptive mechanisms
(co)evolve, this study compares the ecological and evolutionary
population consequences of three very different responses to
environmental heterogeneity: matching habitat choice (directed gene
flow), adaptive plasticity (associated with random gene flow), and
divergent natural selection. Using individual-based simulations, we show
that matching habitat choice can have a greater adaptive potential than
plasticity or natural selection: it allows for local adaptation while
protecting genetic polymorphism despite global mating or strong
environmental changes. Our simulations further reveal that increasing
environmental fluctuations and unpredictability generally favor the
emergence of specialist genotypes but that matching habitat choice is
better at preventing local maladaptation by individuals. This confirms
that matching habitat choice can speed up the genetic divergence among
populations, cause indirect assortative mating via spatial clustering,
and hence even facilitate sympatric speciation. This study highlights
the potential importance of directed dispersal in local adaptation and
speciation, stresses the difficulty of deriving its operation from
nonexperimental observational data alone, and helps define a set of
ecological conditions which should favor its emergence and subsequent
detection in nature.},

abstract = {Population density around the natal site is often invoked as an
explanation for variation in dispersal distance, with the expectation
that competition for limiting resources, coupled with increased
intra-specific aggression at high densities, should drive changes in
dispersal distances. However, tests of the density-dependent dispersal
hypothesis in long-lived vertebrates have yielded mixed results.
Furthermore, conclusions from dispersal studies may depend on the
spatial and temporal scales at which density and dispersal patterns are
examined, yet multi-scale studies of dispersal are rare. Here, we
present the findings of a long-term study examining factors influencing
natal dispersal distances for the non-migratory population of Peregrine
Falcons (Falco peregrinus) in the British Isles across distinct spatial
and temporal scales. Our smallest scale study included Peregrines ringed
as nestlings and subsequently recaptured alive in south Scotland-north
England, an area that was intensively studied during the time periods
1974-1982 and 2002-2016. Second, we examined dispersal patterns of birds
ringed as nestlings in south Scotland-north England, but subsequently
recaptured alive or recovered dead anywhere in the British Isles.
Finally, we examined the natal dispersal patterns for Peregrines ringed
and recaptured or recovered anywhere in the British Isles from 1964 to
2016. Consistent with prior findings, females dispersed farther than
males across all scales. However, the patterns of dispersal were
strongly scale dependent. Specifically, we found a lack of a discernible
relationship between index of density and dispersal distance in the
limited study area, but when region-wide recaptures and recoveries were
included in the analyses, a negative relationship was revealed. Our
results suggest that conclusions of dispersal studies may be scale
dependent, highlighting the importance of spatial and temporal scales in
examining and interpreting the relationship between population density
and dispersal patterns.},

abstract = {1. River network structure influences many important population and
community processes. Previous work examining ecological dynamics in
river networks has focused on within-trophic-level dynamics, with less
emphasis on food-web interactions. Yet, trophic interactions in rivers
are influenced by processes that may interact with network structure and
position.
2. Using a spatially explicit consumer-resource model, we explore how
trophic dynamics are influenced by the branching nature of river
networks. We focus on cases where the consumer-resource interaction is
prone to temporal oscillations and periodic low population sizes. In
these cases, we find that the influence of network structure and
dispersal can reduce temporal variability and increase persistence of
consumers and resources at the metacommunity scale.
3. The effects of network structure and dispersal on our observed
metacommunity dynamics result from asynchrony among dynamics of local
communities: when asynchronous local fluctuations are averaged,
consumer-resource dynamics become less variable and bounded higher above
zero at regional spatial scales. Fluctuations synchronise across
clusters of linked local communities.
4. Communities that connect to only one other downstream community
typically vary independently of other patches and show high variability,
while communities that are linked to multiple upstream and downstream
habitats show greater clustering and less variability. These patterns
suggest that headwater versus mainstem locations in river networks may
show different levels of population variability and thus differential
responses to management and restoration efforts.},

perspective to disentangle the effects of individual species on
community assembly in a dry tropical forest of southern Ecuador. We
completely mapped a forest plot of 9 ha, and measured several functional
traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, wood density, seed mass and
maximum height) for tree and shrub species. To account for stochastic
and habitat filtering effects, we fitted spatial point processes for the
23 more abundant species in the plot, which confirmed that all species
responded to plot scale habitat filtering and 14 were dispersal-limited.
We tested the hypothesis that facilitative interactions would be
prevalent in this dry forest. For this, we compared the distribution of
taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic (PD) diversity in the
neighborhood of the studied species with the diversity expected under a
null model combining habitat filtering and stochastic assembly. We found
that in the fine spatial scales where species interactions are expected
to occur (i.e., neighborhoods of 1-20 m) eight species did not show any
significant pattern for TD, FD or PD. Eleven species showed evidences of
facilitation (i.e., accumulated more TD than expected) but in some cases
the facilitated neighborhoods had more FD or PD than expected,
suggesting the joint effect of facilitation and competition based on
niche differences. One species showed less TD than expected, accompanied
by lower FD and higher PD, suggesting competition based on fitness
differences.
Our study shows that in this dry tropical forest, where abiotic stress
is prevalent, the assembly of diversity is controlled by environmental
heterogeneity and both facilitative and competitive biotic processes,
all of them acting simultaneously and at the same scale in the same

biodiversity. Yet the impact of habitat fragmentation, or the change in
habitat configuration for a given amount of habitat loss, has been
intensely debated. We isolated effects of habitat loss from
fragmentation on the demography, movement, and abundance of wild
populations of a specialist herbivore, Chelinidea vittiger, by removing
2,088 patches across 15 landscapes. We compared fragmentation resulting
from random loss, which is often considered in theory, to aggregated
loss, which is often observed in the real world. When quantifying
fragmentation caused by random vs. aggregated loss, aggregated loss led
to less fragmented landscapes than random loss based on patch isolation,
but more fragmented landscapes when based on isolation at a larger
mesoscale scale defined by dispersal distances of C.vittiger. Overall,
habitat loss decreased population size and demographic parameters, with
thresholds occurring at approximately 70-80% patch loss. Synergistic
effects also occurred, where an aggregated pattern of loss had negative
effects at low, but not high, amounts of habitat loss. Effects on
population size of C.vittiger were driven by reductions in movement and
subsequent reproduction. The direction of habitat fragmentation effects
from random and aggregated loss treatments, for a given habitat amount,
was conflictingly positive or negative depending on the scale at which
fragmentation was quantified. Fragmentation quantified at the scale of
dispersal for this species best explained population size and
highlighted that fragmentation had negative effects at a mesoscale. Our
results emphasize the importance of quantifying habitat fragmentation at

(Procnias tricarunculatus) feeds primarily upon the fruit of Lauraceae
species during its reproductive and post-reproductive seasons. To
understand and advance appropriate conservation measures, this study
identified the bellbird's foraging challenges in its search for a
temporally and spatially fluctuating resource. Although there are at
least 96 species of Lauraceae found in the five life zones of
Monteverde, the distinct distributions of tree species both among and
within life zones require the bellbirds to track seasonal fruiting
across the various zones. In this 6-year study, we monitored the
fruiting of tree species and bellbird abundance in 24 study plots within
its post-reproductive life zone, the Premontane Wet forest, to identify
preferred bellbird food resources and how the fruiting of these species
drives the spatial distribution of the bellbird. Our research revealed
phenological patterns of annual, biennial, and triennial fruiting with
high levels of fruiting synchrony within several identified key fruit
species. Of critical conservation importance is that no single species
of Lauraceae produced a consistent food supply for bellbirds each year.
Therefore, even within life zones, the bellbird's survival depends on
its mobility to search for and obtain fruit, as well as the availability
of fruits of multiple tree species. The conservation implications
include focused attention on multiple core areas within given life
zones, protection of existing forest and remnant trees, and forest
restoration with plantings of multiple tree species. We suspect that
other tropical frugivorous species face similar conservation challenges.},

threatening processes driving biodiversity loss, especially in the
tropics. Although the potential impacts of each threat have been widely
studied in isolation, few studies have assessed the impacts of climate
and land cover change in combination. Here, we evaluate the exposure of
a large mammalian clade, bats, to multiple scenarios of environmental
change and dispersal to understand potential consequences for
biodiversity conservation.
Location: Mexico.
Methods: We used ensemble species distribution models to forecast
changes in environmental suitability for 130 bat species that occur in
Mexico by 2050s under four dispersal assumptions and four combined
climate and land use change scenarios. We identified regions with the
strongest projected impacts for each scenario and assessed the overlap
across scenarios.
Results: The combined effects of climate and land use change will cause
an average reduction in environmental suitability for 51% of the
species across their range, regardless of scenario. Overall, species
show a mean decrease in environmental suitability in at least 46% of
their current range in all scenarios of change and dispersal. Climate
scenarios had a higher impact on species environmental suitability than
land use scenarios. There was a spatial overlap of 43% across the four
environmental change scenarios for the regions projected to have the
strongest impacts.
Main conclusions: Combined effects of future environmental change may
result in substantial declines in environmental suitability for Mexican
bats even under optimistic scenarios. This study highlights the
vulnerability of megadiverse regions and an indicator taxon to human
disturbance. The consideration of combined threats can make an important
difference in how we react to changes to conserve our biodiversity as

investigating factors governing male dynamics and their influence on
population sustainability. Lions display sexually selected infanticide,
and resident males must defend their offspring from nomads that may have
dispersed over long distances; factors affecting male-male competition
over large spatial scales can have population wide consequences. We
report here on the first systematic analysis of long-term
individual-based data of male lions in the Serengeti National Park,

the impacts on the resident population. The yearly number of nomadic
males entering the study population affected cub survival and mating
access. Success rates of nomadic males gaining tenure with a pride
increased with age and coalition size. We observed a significant decline
in male immigration, which resulted in lowered levels of male
replacement in the study population, reduced infanticide, and greater
cub survival. The decline in incoming males likely resulted from
increased anthropogenic pressures in surrounding areas. Conversely, the
core study population was largely buffered from anthropogenic threats
and likely served as a source to neighboring sinks. Reduced infanticide
in the core population might have compensated for rising lion

abstract = {One of the hypothesized benefits of seed dispersal is to escape density- and distance-responsive, host-specific, natural enemies near maternal plants where conspecific seed and seedling densities are high. Such high conspecific neighbor densities typically result in lower offspring growth and survival (i.e., negative density-dependent effects), yet many dispersal modes result in clumped seed distributions. New World leaf-nosed bats transport fruits to their feeding roosts and deposit seeds, thereby creating high-density seed/seedling patches beneath feeding roosts in heterospecific trees away from maternal trees, which seemingly nullifies a key benefit of seed dispersal. Such dispersal may still be adaptive if negative density-dependent effects are reduced under feeding roosts or if the benefit of being dispersed away from maternal trees outweighs negative effects of conspecific seed/seedling density below roosts. We mapped the entire post-germination population of a bat-dispersed tree species Calophyllum longifolium (Calophyllaceae) in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama in each of three successive years. We tested two hypotheses: (1) distance-dependent effects are stronger than density-dependent effects on seedling performance because seedlings far from conspecific adults are more likely to escape natural enemies even when at high densities and (2) negative density-dependent effects will be reduced far from vs. near conspecific adults. Density and distance were naturally decoupled, as expected. However, in contrast to our expectation, we found positive density effects on seedling survival and density-dependent effects did not differ with distance from conspecific adults. Both density and distance had positive effects on seedling survival when considered together, while only year had a significant effect on seedling growth. Thus, both being dispersed under bat feeding roosts and escaping the vicinity of conspecific adults were beneficial for C. longifolium seedling survival, supporting the directed dispersal and escape hypotheses, respectively. Despite resulting in high densities of conspecific seedlings, favorable habitat under bat feeding roosts and lack of negative density-dependent effects appear to provide evolutionary advantages in C. longifolium.},

abstract = {1. Bumblebees inhabit spatially heterogeneous landscapes that are likely
characterized by population sources and sinks. To date, most studies of
bumblebee habitat requirements have examined static relationships
between worker abundance and habitat characteristics. However, if
habitat types are linked by dispersal, source-sink dynamics could alter
overall population sensitivity to habitat loss, changing conclusions
from static approaches.
2. Here, we used empirically derived spatial matrix models to study
source-sink population dynamics of bumblebees in heterogeneous
environments. We used these models to assess population sensitivity to
habitat loss and to examine the population dynamics that could occur
under rapid habitat change.
3. Loss of natural habitat reduced long-term population growth rates,
and more natural habitat was required to sustain bumblebee species with
long-distance dispersal than species with short-distance dispersal. The
long-term relative density of colonies in each habitat type depended on
landscape structure and bumblebee dispersal ability. Under most
conditions, high-quality habitat contained higher densities of colonies
than low-quality habitats. However, low-quality habitat could contain
higher densities than high-quality habitats if populations were in
long-term decline.
4. Rapid loss or restoration of natural habitat produced transient
population dynamics that differed from long-term dynamics. After large
landscape perturbations that affected population structure, transient
dynamics persisted for 4-8 years and were longest for species with short
dispersal in highly aggregated landscapes. While transient dynamics were
short in duration, they caused large effects on long-term population
density.
5. Synthesis and applications. When habitats are linked by dispersal or
populations have recently experienced perturbations, patterns of
abundance on the landscape may not reflect variation in habitat quality.
Spatially structured matrix population models are practical tools than
can be used to account for nonequilibrium and source-sink dynamics. For
bumblebees, population sensitivity to habitat loss and the duration of
transient dynamics depend on dispersal ability and landscape
configuration. Demographic approaches such as ours can help to
disentangle population patterns from processes and will therefore be
valuable for guiding conservation and management.},

impacts on population dynamics, we need sex-structured models. Such
models have been shown to produce results different from those predicted
by asexual models, yet need to explicitly consider mating dynamics.
Modeling mating is challenging and no generally accepted formulation
exists. Mating is often impaired at low densities due to difficulties of
individuals in locating mates, a phenomenon termed a mate-finding Allee
effect. Widely applied models of this Allee effect assume either that
only male density determines the rate at which females mate or that male
and female densities are equal. Contrarily, when detailed models of
mating dynamics are sometimes developed, the female mating rate is
rarely reported, making quantification of the mate-finding Allee effect
difficult. Here, we develop an individual-based model of mating dynamics
that accounts for spatial search of one sex for another, and quantify
the rate at which females mate, depending on male and female densities
and under a number of reasonable mating scenarios. We find that this
rate increases with male and female densities (hence observing a
mate-finding Allee effect), in a decelerating or sigmoid way, that
mating can be most efficient at either low or high female densities, and
that the mate search rate may undergo density-dependent selection. We
also show that mate search trajectories evolve to be as straight as
possible when targets are sedentary, yet that when targets move the
search can be less straight without seriously affecting the female
mating rate. Some recommendations for modeling two-sex population

biogeographical processes for the evolution of Amazonian upland forest
birds through a densely sampled analysis of diversification of the
endemic Amazonian genus Rhegmatorhina at multiple taxonomic and temporal
scales.
Location: Amazonia.
Taxon: Antbirds (Thamnophilidae).
Methods: We sequenced four mtDNA and nuclear gene regions of 120
individuals from 50 localities representing all recognized species and
subspecies of the genus. We performed molecular phylogenetic analyses
using both gene tree and species tree methods, molecular dating analysis
and estimated population demographic history and gene flow.
Results: Dense sampling throughout the distribution of Rhegmatorhina
revealed that the main Amazonian rivers delimit the geographic
distribution of taxa as inferred from mtDNA lineages. Molecular
phylogenetic analyses resulted in a strongly supported phylogenetic
hypothesis for the genus, with two main clades currently separated by
the Madeira River. Molecular dating analysis indicated diversification
during the Quaternary. Reconstruction of recent demographic history of
populations revealed a trend for population expansion in eastern
Amazonia and stability in the west. Estimates of gene flow corroborate
the possibility that migration after divergence had some influence on
the current patterns of diversity.
Main Conclusions: Based on broad-scale sampling, a clarification of
taxonomic boundaries, and strongly supported phylogenetic relationships,
we confirm that, first, mitochondrial lineages within this upland forest
Amazonian bird genus agree with spatial patterns known for decades based
on phenotypes, and second, that most lineages are geographically
delimited by the large Amazonian rivers. The association between past
demographic changes related to palaeoclimatic cycles and the
historically varying strength and size of rivers as barriers to
dispersal may be the path to the answer to the long-standing question of
identifying the main drivers of Amazonian diversification.},

responses to these factors for different weed species functional types
was considered by modelling four functional response groups. We used
this model to investigate the effects of increasing the proportion of
permanent meadows in the landscape and of the spatial arrangement of
meadows on weed density in crops. With this model, increasing the
proportion of permanent meadows significantly decreased mean seed
density of weeds in crops. Furthermore, weed density in crops was found
to be lower for landscapes in which the meadows were scattered, rather
than clustered together in large zones. However, these spatial and
landscape-scale effects were much weaker than the local effect of
cropping systems. Weed density in permanent meadows was more sensitive
to the proportion of meadows and to their spatial arrangement than weed
density in crops, although the absolute value of weed density remained
low in this unfavourable habitat.},

anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), currently listed as Vulnerable by
IUCN. Here we analysed the relative effect of fragmentation and
mortality due to roads on giant anteater populations and show the
critical areas for their persistence in Brazil. We estimated minimum
patch size and maximum road density to evaluate the impact of the road
network and observed road-kills on this species. We explored different
scenarios by varying values of dispersal capacity to estimate the
minimum patch size, and also of population densities to estimate maximum
road density for giant anteater persistence. Our findings indicated that
the minimum patch size can be from 498 to 247 km(2) and the maximum road
density can vary between 0.21 and 0.55 km/km(2) in pessimist and
optimistic scenarios, respectively. In Brazil, habitat fragmentation
seemed to have a major impact over giant anteater populations. Habitat
fragmentation due to roads seemed to have a more negative effect than
mortality due to collisions with vehicles. Critical areas for the
species persistence can represent 32% of its range in the optimistic
scenario with 18% of suitable patches below the minimum size and 0.1%
above the maximum road density. This study provides insights and
implications for road networks on giant anteater populations in Brazil

what extent spread of the tick vector (Ixodes scapularis) and the
pathogen (Borrelia burgdorferi) are dependent upon the dispersal of
vertebrate hosts in spatially heterogeneous landscapes. Yet, empirical
measure of these complex ecologically driven spread processes present
conceptual and methodological challenges despite important public health
implications.ObjectivesTo examine the relationship between landscape
characteristics and tick-borne disease spread, we modeled the influence
of landscape connectivity for a simplified vertebrate host community
(white-footed mousePeromyscus leucopus, American robinTurdus
migratorius, white-tailed deerOdocoileus virginianus) on the potential
spread of the tick population compared to the pathogen in a
spatially-structured landscape.MethodsWe parameterized a hybrid
demographic-dispersal connectivity model by combining a series of
reported host dispersal and tick burden estimates with
empirically-measured tick abundance and pathogen prevalence sampled from
a Lyme-endemic island landscape in Thousand Islands National Park
(Ontario, Canada) and simulated several tick- and pathogen-spread
scenarios.ResultsThe extent of tick spread by mice {[}amount of
reachable habitat (ARH)=18.0%] is considerably similar to that of
robins (ARH=18.7%), while deer support the greatest tick spread extent
(ARH=82.0%). Infected mice carrying ticks support the highest pathogen
spread (ARH=19.8%). Short-distance pathogenspread and long-distance
tick spread were facilitated by intermediate stepping stone habitat
fragments.ConclusionsWe provide evidence that host functional
connectivity mediates tick spread differently than pathogen spread, and
depends strongly on landscape configuration. Our study therefore
emphasizes the importance of landscape spatial heterogeneity on the
ecological processes that influence regional tick-borne disease spread.},

annual crops vs. semi-natural habitats (woody elements) on insect

Spatial continuities between spring and winter crops (in 250 m radius

complementation processes. The connectivity of annual crops also had
positive effects on abundances of dimorphic farmland species in maize
crops and of forest species in woodland, but at contrasted spatial

dispersal, or migration, is a fundamental aspect of ecology that shapes
spatial abundance distributions, genetic compositions, and dynamics of
populations. A variety of movement models have been used for predicting
the effects of natural or human-caused landscape changes, invading
species, or other disturbances on local ecology. Here we introduce the
flow network-a general modeling framework for population dynamics and
movement in a metapopulation representing a network of habitat sites
(nodes). Based on the principles of physical transport phenomena such as
fluid flow through pipes (Pouiselle's Law) and analogously, the flow of
electric current across a circuit (Ohm's Law), the flow network provides
a novel way of modeling movement, where flow rates are functions of
relative node pressures and the resistance to movement between them.
Flow networks offer the flexibility of incorporating abiotic and biotic
conditions that affect either pressures, resistance, or both. To
illustrate an application of the flow network, we present a theoretical
invasion scenario. We consider the effects of spatial structure on the
speed of invasion by varying the spatial regularity of node arrangement.
In the context of invasion, we model management actions targeting nodes
or edges, and consider the effects on speed of invasion, node
occupation, and total abundance. The flow network approach offers the
flexibility to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in both rates of flow
and site pressures and offers an intuitive approach to connecting
population dynamics and landscape features to model movement.},

Such conditions should reduce evolutionary potential, while increasing

microsatellite data, we (1) investigated historical (i.e.,

the study area. The proportion of individuals that were recent
immigrants among all subpopulations were low. Habitat fragmentation has
led to a clear division between subpopulations in the east and west, and
the patterns of gene flow exchange between these two regions have
changed over time. The effective population size estimates for these two
regions are now well below that required for long-term population
viability (N-e<100). Demographic history models indicate that genetic
drift was a greater influence on subpopulations than gene flow, and most

worldwide. The species is considered invasive in several regions. While
in the native range, post-dispersal seed predation is known to severely
limit eucalypt recruitment, there is no experimental evidence of seed
predation in the introduced range. We hypothesised that E. globulus
seeds largely escape predation in Portugal, which may explain its
prolific recruitment in some locations. We tested this hypothesis in
central Portugal by exposing E. globulus seeds to the local fauna. For
comparison purposes, we also used seeds from locally common species:
Acacia dealbata Link (alien, larger, elaiosome-bearing seeds) and Cistus
salviifolius L. (native, similarly sized seeds). We installed 30 feeding
stations across three study sites, each one dominated by one study
species. Each feeding station featured four feeders with different
animal-access treatments: invertebrates; vertebrates; full access; no
access (control). We placed five seeds of each plant species every day
in each feeder and registered the number of seeds missing, eaten and
elaiosome detached over 9 summer days.
Eucalyptus globulus seeds were highly attractive to fauna in the three
sites. Nearly half of E. globulus seeds were predated or removed, thus
contradicting our hypothesis. Surprisingly, E. globulus and A. dealbata
seeds were used by animals in similar proportions and C. salviifolius
seeds were the least preferred. Vertebrates were the predominant seed
predators and preferred the alien seeds. Invertebrates used all seed
species in similar proportions. We found spatial variation regarding the
predominant type of seed predators and the levels of seed predation
according to the following patterns: predominance of vertebrates;
predominance of invertebrates; negligible seed predator activity.
Locations with negligible seed predation were abundant and scattered
across the study area. Such spatial variation may help to explain the
heterogeneous recruitment patterns of E. globulus seedlings found in
previous studies.},

Major taxa studiedMethodsVascular plants.
We sampled riparian forest plant communities along an urban-to-rural
gradient and used redundancy analysis to identify predictors of species
composition patterns for groups of species categorized by nativity and
seed dispersal mode. We first compared the ability of different models
of habitat connectivity (least-cost paths that avoided urban land cover
versus Euclidean and along-stream distance) to explain spatial patterns
of species composition. We then partitioned the variation in species
composition explained by habitat connectivity models, local
environmental conditions and measures of urbanization in the surrounding
landscape.
ResultsMain conclusionsWe found that several groups of native species
were best explained by least-cost path models that avoided urban
development, suggesting that urbanization impedes dispersal within this
landscape, particularly for short-dispersed species. Environmental
variables related to urbanization (e.g., temperature, stream incision)
were important predictors of species composition for many species
groups, but measures of urbanization in the surrounding landscape were
more important for exotic than for native species.
Our results demonstrate that urbanization influences plant species
composition via its effects on both habitat connectivity and
environmental conditions. However, the strength of these effects varies
somewhat predictably across seed dispersal modes and between native and
exotic species. These results highlight the importance of
landscape-scale planning for urban conservation.},

connectivity of Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) along similar to
1,200km of the California Current System (CCS). We sampled individuals
at 33 sites in 2012 to establish a baseline of genetic diversity and
hierarchal population genetic structure and then assessed interannual
variability in our estimates by sampling again in 2014. Genetic
diversity showed little variation among sites or across years. In 2012,
we observed weak genetic differentiation among sites (F-ST range =
-0.005-0.014) following a pattern of isolation by distance (IBD) and
significantly high relatedness among individuals within nine sampling
sites. In 2014, pairwise F-ST estimates were lower (F-ST range =
-0.014-0.007), there was no spatial autocorrelation, and fewer sites had
significant evidence of relatedness. Based on these findings, we propose
that interannual variation in the physical oceanographic conditions of
the CCS influences larval recruitment and thus gene flow, contributing
to interannual variation in population genetic structure. Estimates of
effective population size (N-e) were large in both 2012 and 2014.
Together, our results suggest that Dungeness crab in the CCS may
constitute a single evolutionary population, although geographically
limited dispersal results in an ephemeral signal of IBD. Furthermore,
our findings demonstrate that populations of marine organisms may be
susceptible to temporal changes in population genetic structure over
short time periods; thus, interannual variability in population genetic
measures should be considered.},

patches between 3900-4500 masl, we employed generalized mixed modelling
to identify the significant associations of seedling densities with
environmental covariates. In addition, we compared these associations to
patterns of adult presence on the landscape. Seedling densities were
associated with a combination of variables varying within (distance to
forest edge) and among (elevation and dry season solar irradiation)
plots across the landscape. For both species, seedling densities
decreased with increasing distance away from the forest in a manner
consistent with short-distance seed dispersal by wind. Our results
suggest that such short-distance dispersal may slow forest expansion,
but that there also appear to be substantial post-dispersal limitations
to seedling establishment in the grassland. Polylepis sericea densities
decreased with elevation, while P.weberbaueri increased with elevation
and decreased with solar irradiation. Associations of adult presence
with elevation and solar irradiation mirrored those of seedling
densities. Management of areas with forest patches dominated by these

tolerances, particularly during species selection and zonation for
reforestation.},

internationally important area for migratory birds, but in which 44% of
wetlands have been reclaimed. We evaluated the suitability of sites for
offsetting based on their ecological similarity to development sites,
the potential of biota to migrate between sites and socio-economic
criteria. We predicted that 60-100% of all reclamation in the Yellow

no constraints were placed on where offsetting occurs within the region.
However, where potential offset sites were constrained to areas with
high suitability only 8-15% of historic coastal reclamation could be
offset. Spatial options for offsetting also declined where time lags
before restoration were longer. Our results indicated that strict
in-kind biodiversity offsetting becomes increasingly challenging in
highly modified landscapes because of a lack of spatial options for
offsets and a tendency for potential offset sites to be dissimilar to
the habitat that originally occurred on developed sites in these
landscapes. Policies that seek to enable development within highly
modified landscapes by providing flexibility for offsetting in space and
time risk providing offsets that are ecologically dissimilar from
development sites and have limited capacity for biota to migrate to or

the ideal-free-distribution model, density drives organism choice and
ultimately distribution among habitats. However, deviations from the
basic model are common, as it does not take into account intrinsic and
extrinsic constraints. Two important constraints are those of habitat
geometry (e.g. habitat area, habitat shape), and perceptual range. We
used a trap-building predator, the wormlion larva, to examine these
constraints. We manipulated the geometry of the preferred shaded
microhabitat and the distance of individuals from it, and assessed their
effect on wormlion habitat choice, distribution patterns, and
performance. Habitat geometry affected wormlion microhabitat choice and
distribution patterns, measured as distance from the habitat center and
spatial pattern type, but had no effect on performance, expressed as the
area of the pit-trap constructed. The interaction between habitat
geometry and density was inconsistent regarding the distribution
patterns, affecting distance from the center but not the spatial pattern
type. Furthermore, we found that wormlions demonstrated a low perceptual
range, which limited their ability to sense proximate shaded conditions.
We highlight the importance of incorporating the interplay between

underestimate mechanisms of bacterial assemblages at lower taxonomic
levels. In this context, the study aimed to identify factors affecting
the spatial and temporal dynamic of the Mycobacterium, a genus
widespread in aquatic ecosystems. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)
density variations were quantified in the water column of freshwater
lakes at the regional scale (annual monitoring of 49 lakes in the Paris
area) and at the local scale (2-year monthly monitoring in Creteil Lake)
by real-time quantitative PCR targeting the atpE gene. At the regional
scale, mycobacteria densities in water samples ranged from 6.7 x 10(3)
to 1.9 x 10(8) genome units per liter. Density variations were primarily
explained by water pH, labile iron, and dispersal processes through the
connection of the lakes to a river. In Creteil Lake, no spatial
variation of mycobacterial densities was noticed over the 2-year monthly
survey, except after large rainfall events. Indeed, storm sewer
effluents locally and temporarily increased NTM densities in the water
column. The temporal dynamic of the NTM densities in Creteil Lake was
associated with suspended solid concentrations. No clear seasonal
variation was noticed despite a shift in NTM densities observed over the
2012-2013 winter. Temporal NTM densities fluctuations were well
predicted by the neutral community model, suggesting a random balance
between loss and gain of mycobacterial taxa within Creteil Lake. This
study highlights the importance of considering multiple spatial scales

abstract = {Seed dispersal by frugivores, particularly primates, plays an important role in structuring and maintaining tree diversity in tropical forests. However, little is known about the effect of frugivores on the diversity of saplings and large trees. We used detailed census data from the fully mapped 30-ha Mo Singto forest dynamics plot in Thailand together with spatial point pattern analysis to find out if the local species richness of small (dbh <10cm) and large (dbh 10cm) trees in the neighbourhood of large trees of 52 focal species was larger or smaller than expected by an appropriate null model. We then used binary data (+ or 0) on the seed dispersal network at the Mo Singto plot to test the hypothesis that the major primate frugivores, rather than other arboreal frugivores, generated patterns of locally increased species richness around their preferred diet species (i.e. accumulator effects). More than half of the focal species showed accumulator effects with respect to species richness of small trees (<10cm in diameter), but accumulator effects with respect to large trees were weak and not consistent with those of small trees. Primate-dispersed focal species (but not hornbill- or other smaller bird-dispersed species) showed significantly larger positive effect sizes than the remaining focal species.Synthesis. Our analysis suggests that primatesas major drivers of contagious seed dispersalgenerate species-rich seed rain around their preferred food-tree species, which results in significantly larger local species richness of saplings. This is likely a consequence of heterospecific seed rain that reduces negative density dependence, and the presence of the accumulator pattern which persists at least until the large-size stage. Hence, extirpation of primates may result in significant changes in the diversity and spatial structure of tropical forests.},

abstract = {Understanding the mutualistic services provided by species is critical when considering both the consequences of their loss or the benefits of their reintroduction. Like many other Pacific islands, New Zealand seed dispersal networks have been changed by both significant losses of large frugivorous birds and the introduction of invasive mammals. These changes are particularly concerning when important dispersers remain unidentified. We tested the impact of frugivore declines and invasive seed predators on seed dispersal for an endemic tree, hinau Elaeocarpus dentatus, by comparing seed dispersal and predation rates on the mainland of New Zealand with offshore sanctuary islands with higher bird and lower mammal numbers. We used cameras and seed traps to measure predation and dispersal from the ground and canopy, respectively. We found that canopy fruit handling rates (an index of dispersal quantity) were poor even on island sanctuaries (only 14% of seeds captured below parent trees on islands had passed through a bird), which suggests that hinau may be adapted for ground-based dispersal by flightless birds. Ground-based dispersal of hinau was low on the New Zealand mainland compared to sanctuary islands (4% of seeds dispersed on the mainland vs. 76% dispersed on islands), due to low frugivore numbers. A flightless endemic rail (Gallirallus australis) conducted the majority of ground-based fruit removal on islands. Despite being threatened, this rail is controversial in restoration projects because of its predatory impacts on native fauna. Our study demonstrates the importance of testing which species perform important mutualistic services, rather than simply relying on logical assumptions.},

abstract = {1. Quantifying the relative importance of how local (environmental or
niche-based) and regional (dispersal-related or spatial) processes
regulate the assembly of communities has become one of the main research
avenues of community ecology. It has been shown that the degree of
isolation of local habitats in the landscape may substantially influence
the relative role of environmental filtering and dispersal-related
processes in metacommunities.
2. Dendritic stream networks are unique habitats in the landscape, where
more isolated upstream sites have been predicted to be primarily
structured by environmental variables, while more central mainstem
rivers by both environmental and spatial variables (hereafter the
network position hypothesis, NPH). However, the NPH has almost
exclusively been tested for stream macroinvertebrates, and therefore its
predictions warrant confirmation from multiple taxa.
3. We examined the validity of the NPH for benthic diatoms, macrophytes,
macroinvertebrates and fish in the Pannon Ecoregion, Hungary. Following
the NPH we predicted a clear dominance of environmental over spatial
variables in headwaters, and a larger effect of spatial variables in
rivers compared to headwaters. We tested these predictions using
variance partitioning analyses separately for the different taxa in
headwater and in riverine habitats.
4. We found large differences in the explained community variance when
the impact of environmental (physical and chemical) and spatial
(overland and watercourse distance) variables for various taxa was
studied. In general, total explained variance was lower for the more
passively dispersing plant taxa than for animal taxa with more active
dispersal in both streams and rivers. However, similar to other studies,
the total explained variance was low for both headwater streams and
rivers.
5. Community structure of diatoms could be best explained by both
environmental and spatial variables in streams, whereas their community
structure could not be explained by either variable group in rivers. The
significance of environmental and spatial variables depended on the
distance measure (overland versus watercourse) in the case of
macrophytes. Community structure of macroinvertebrates could be
explained by environmental variables in streams and by both
environmental and spatial variables in rivers. Moreover, variation was
explained by different predictors when macroinvertebrate taxa were
divided into flying and non-flying groups, suggesting the importance of
dispersal mode in explaining community variation. Finally, community
structure of fishes could be explained by both environmental and spatial
variables in streams and only by environmental variables in rivers.
6. In conclusion, we found no clear evidence of the NPH in our
multi-taxa comparison. For example, while patterns in macroinvertebrate
communities seem to support the NPH, those in fish communities run
counter with the predictions of the NPH. This study thus shows that
different taxa may behave differently to isolation effects in stream
networks. We discuss alternatives in the interpretation of dispersal (or
spatial) effects which may partly explain differences in the observed
patterns from the NPH, and emphasise the need for further studies in
unravelling the importance of isolation in stream metacommunity
structuring.},

lens of specialists and generalists to predict species diversity and
distribution patterns and to ameliorate worldwide declines in specialist
species. Dispersal traits are assumed to be associated with
specialization (specialists are weaker dispersers than generalists), but
dispersal modes can be variable within groups. Niche-based predictions
of occupancy and environmental responses were assessed using
invertebrates from California vernal pools that were categorized by
specialization (endemic or widespread taxa) and dispersal mode (passive
or active dispersal). Data from a latitudinal gradient resulted in
widespread taxa with greater percent occupancy than endemic taxa as
predicted, but passive dispersers had greater occupancy than active
dispersers in contrast to predictions. Endemic species and
widespread-active dispersers exhibited similar levels of specialization
measured as coefficient of variation among treatments in a mesocosm
experiment. This suggested that habitat choice was important, and these
differences in specialization were scale dependent (generalists across
habitat types and specialists within a habitat type). A negative
correlation between latitudinal occupancy and level of specialization
demonstrated how local-scale responses and landscape patterns were
related and depend on both specialization and dispersal traits. This
study underscores how habitat heterogeneity and species traits,
including specialization and dispersal, can interact to affect community
patterns at different spatial scales.},

equally maintains plant diversity, though the latter receives little
empirical attention. Discerning the temporal and spatial components of
seed dispersal and understanding how their interaction shapes fragmented
communities and maintains their diversity may be pivotal to further our
ecological understanding of spatial and temporal seed dispersal and its
implications for landscape-scale conservation management. To investigate
the relative importance of spatial and temporal seed dispersal and their
roles in maintaining plant diversity, the herb layer and seed bank of
grassland communities were inventoried in 77 sites across abandoned and
intact rotational grazing networks in a 100 km(2) fragmented grassland
landscape in the Stockholm archipelago (Baltic Sea, Sweden). Besides
analysing alpha- and beta-diversity patterns, nestedness analyses
connect deterministic community changes and diversity losses with
dispersal-related life-history traits and habitat specialization to
identify the mechanism driving community changes and maintaining local
diversity. The loss of rotational grazing networks caused community
diversity declines via non-random extinctions of spatially and
temporally poor dispersers, particularly among grassland specialists.
Temporal seed dispersal halted further community disassembly,
maintaining diversity in the abandoned grazing networks. Spatial
dispersal within the intact grazing networks was found to be an
overriding, homogenizing agent conserving diversity in both the herb
layer and seed bank. This empirical evidence establishes how spatial and
temporal seed dispersal interact to maintain diversity in fragmented
landscapes. Poorly connected grasslands appear limited by spatial
dispersal, yet are maintained by temporal seed dispersal. In fragmented
landscapes where grazing networks are rarely present, temporal rather
than spatial seed dispersal may be more important in maintaining species
diversity, since effective spatial dispersal may be significantly
diminished. The grazing network's efficacy at boosting spatial dispersal
and upholding community diversity presents a powerful management tool to
conserve local and regional species diversity.},

abstract = {Plant endemism in the European Alps is clustered into particular
geographic areas. Two contrasted and non exclusive hypotheses have been
suggested to explain these hotspots of endemism: (i) those areas were
glacial refugia, where endemism reflects survival-recolonisation
dynamics since the onset of Pleistocene glaciations, (ii) those are high
elevation mountain areas, where endemism was fostered by local
speciation events due to geographic isolation and harsh environmental
niches, or by low dispersal ability of inhabiting species.
Here, we quantitatively compared these two hypotheses using data of
species distribution in the European Alps (IntraBioDiv database),
species phylogenetic relationships, and species ecological and
biological characteristics. We developed a spatially and
phylogenetically explicit modeling framework to analyze spatial patterns
of endemism and the phylogenetic structure of species assemblages.
Moreover, we analyzed interrelations between species trait syndromes and
endemism.
We found that high endemism occurrs in potential glacial refugia, but
only those on calcareous bedrock, and also in areas with high elevation.
Plant assemblages in calcareous refugia showed phylogenetic
overdispersion - a signature of non-selective conservation forces,
whereas those located in high mountain areas showed phylogenetic
clustering -a signature of recent diversification and environmental
filtering. Endemic species were either stress-tolerant, poorly
dispersing species, or high elevation specialists with a wide
distribution within the European Alps.
While both calcareous refugia and high-elevation hotspots harbour a
large portion of plant endemism in the European Alps, the species they
host have substantially different characteristics. Our results suggest
that hotspots of endemism in calcareous refugia are more important for
nature conservation planning, as they host many range restricted endemic
species and rather isolated evolutionary lineages.'},

both by dispersal capabilities of the species and changes in the
environment along spatial gradients. Disturbance that affects part of
the network may represent an abrupt change in environmental gradients,
which should be reflected on its communities. We analysed whether the
composition of benthic insect communities is associated to environmental
and geographic distances in a small catchment, partially disturbed by a
wildfire (non burned forest-control: C, moderate impacted: I and burned
zones: B). We postulated that changes in main resource availability
differently affect certain functional feeding groups. We found that
taxonomic differences were related to the disturbance condition but not
to the distance among streams and that the effect of disturbance
targeted mostly on shredders. Environmental differences were larger
among C sites than among B sites, but community taxonomic composition
was more similar among C than B sites. As a result, neither
environmental nor geographic distances explained community similarity.
When the analysis was scaled up by incorporating new data from a larger
area, community similarity was explained both by environmental and
geographic distance, independently (i.e. geographic and environmental
distances did not correlate). Our results highlight the influence of a
disturbance on the riparian vegetation on the benthic community
composition and functional structure of forested streams, and showed the
effect of scale in habitat association, as environmental and geographic

trees, many associated saproxylic (ie. deadwood-dependent) insects are

configuration on saproxylic insect biodiversity and dead wood
decomposition is poorly understood. We performed a six-year
landscape-scale colonization experiment on saproxylic beetles inhabiting
hollow oaks, using boxes filled with wood mould as standardized habitat
patches. We placed boxes either on a hollow tree or on another tree

levels. We quantified wood mould decay and biodiversity in the boxes,
measuring species richness, total abundances and community-weighted mean
of body mass (CWM) as an index of community functional composition.
Isolation had a persistent negative effect on primary consumer
biodiversity, but it only impaired decay at the beginning of the
experiment. All effects were independent of landscape-level (500-m
radius) habitat amount surrounding the boxes. Wood mould decay was
mediated by CWM of primary consumers. Therefore function was driven by
the body masses of the dominant primary consumer species but not by
species numbers (richness) or individual numbers (abundance). Our
experiment shows that small-scale habitat isolation leads to
biodiversity loss and reduced function and indicates that habitats

abstract = {1. Increasing land abandonment in many areas of the world presents an
opportunity for ecosystem recovery, which is often driven by seed
dispersal by vertebrate frugivores. However, we are far from
understanding the most effective way of using common management actions
(i.e. planting fruiting trees) to stimulate animal seed dispersal and
thus the restoration of human-altered abandoned habitats.
2. To investigate how to stimulate animal seed dispersal, we combined
long-term field data with individual-based, spatially explicit
simulation models. We used our approach to assess the effectiveness of
contrasting Iberian pear Pyrus bourgaeana planting strategies in
enhancing restoration of abandoned lands through seed dispersal by red
foxes Vulpes vulpes and Eurasian badgers Meles meles in the Donana World
Biosphere Reserve (South West Spain).
3. Our simulation results indicate that planting trees in an aggregated
fashion is less efficient in terms of seed arrival than planting them
regularly or randomly. For aggregated planted trees, the increase in the
area of the oldfield that received seeds was only 7%-9% compared to
the baseline scenario of no intervention, whereas for regularly
distributed planted trees the increment was up to 40%.
4. Doubling the number of planted P. bourgaeana trees appeared
cost-effective for regular and random tree distributions, but not for
the aggregated one. For example, while doubling the number of trees
planted regularly leads up to 12% increase in the number of seeds
arriving into the oldfield, no increment on the number of -arrived seeds
was detected when trees were planted aggregately.
5. Synthesis and applications. Choosing the spatial distribution and
density of planted trees in abandoned lands depends on a number of
ecological and socio-economical factors. Given our results, the strong
seed dispersal limitation of the target tree population and that our
study site was fully protected for conservation, planting Pyrus
bourgaeana trees regularly appeared to be the most efficient strategy to
enhance seed arrival into the target oldfield. Combining long-term field
data with individual-based, spatially explicit simulation models have
the potential to guide local restoration efforts in diverse
human-altered habitats and thus bridge the -existing gap between basic
and applied research on animal seed dispersal.},

intersected by busy roads. Near Threatened Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo
(Dendrolagus lumholtzi) is a large (5-10 kg) semi-arboreal mammal found
in populated rural and forested areas of north-eastern Australia.
Warning signs, rope bridges and underpasses have not prevented similar
to 20 animals being killed on the road each year.
Aims. To identify factors influencing Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo vehicle
strike to help inform mitigation options.
Methods. Citizen sightings (1998-2000) and 90 road-kills collected over
4.5 years on the Atherton Tablelands, Australia, were examined to
determine the causes of vehicle strike in Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo. The
spatial distributions of sightings and road-kills were characterised
using nearest-neighbour analysis, and the relationship between them was
determined using a Bayesian approach that accounted for spatial
autocorrelation. Gender, age, weight, season, rainfall, road and verge
characteristics, traffic volumes, speed limits and mitigation measures
were recorded to assess their influence on road-kill risk. Adequacy of
speed limits to prevent collisions along road sections with more than
four road-kills per 8 km (hazard zones) was assessed from visibility and
stopping distances.
Key results. Vehicle strikes mainly affected male tree-kangaroos (2-5
years, 5.5-8 kg), occurred where live animals were most frequently
sighted and were most likely on roads with narrow verges, low visibility
and medium traffic volumes. Speed limits at hazard zones were inadequate
to prevent collisions. Few warning signs corresponded with these zones,
and road mortalities persisted where they did.
Conclusions. Unpredictable dispersal of young males and vehicle speeds
unsuited to road conditions drive road mortalities in Lumholtz's
tree-kangaroo. Because tree-kangaroos do not appear to respond to
existing mitigation measures, reducing traffic speeds, and increasing
visibility, appear to be the most effective mitigation strategies for
reducing tree-kangaroo road mortality.},

edges may reduce some of their negative effects, such as their
permeability to biological invasions and detrimental effects on

LocationMediterranean scrublands in SW Spain.
MethodsWe made offerings of a total of 16,000 seeds of eight species of
fleshy-fruit shrubs both along SLD edges and scrubland interiors in two
independent blocks in each of three distant locations. Using four types
of selective enclosure, we assessed the relative contribution of three
seed predator guilds (ants, rodents and birds) to seed predation rates
both along SLD edges and scrubland interiors.
ResultsThe effects of anthropogenic edges on seed predation rates were
species-specific. The large and hard-seeded species Chamaerops humilis
was not predated at all. Juniperus phoenicea and Corema album seeds had
higher predation rates in scrubland interiors than in edges. The
small-seeded Rubus ulmifolius experienced relatively low seed predation
rates compared to the other species. Predation rates for this species
were higher along SLD edges than in scrubland interiors. Ants were the
main seed predators in the area, and showed marked preferences for
J.macrocarpa and C.album seeds at both SLD edges and scrubland
interiors.
ConclusionsOur results show the strong context-dependency of seed
predation rates in both SLD edges and scrubland interiors, and thus the
importance of well spatially and temporally replicated studies. Species
with large and hard seeds may be good candidates for roadside
revegetation programmes. However, the relative suitability of plant
species would depend on the seed predator community. Our findings
confirm that studies on seed predation may help planning cost-effective
species selection for edge revegetation efforts worldwide.},

abstract = {Aim: The management of the rapid expansion of wild ungulate populations
is a challenging task and a societal priority. Using a progressive
database of red (Cervus elaphus) and roe (Capreolus capreolus) deer
colonization over the last three decades, we estimate the range
expansion rates and the underlying mechanisms involved in the expansion
patterns of red and roe deer populations at the south-western edge of
its European distribution.
Location: Mainland Portugal.
Methods: We compiled and grouped historical red and roe deer
distribution data in three time periods (1981-1990, 1991-2000 and
2001-2010). We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate how
biotic and abiotic drivers determine the expansion patterns of red and
roe deer.
Results: We reported a significant expansion of red and roe deer
populations during the last three decades. The significant interaction
between propagule pressure and land cover suggests that the effects of
propagule pressure vary along environmental gradients. We found that the
influence of livestock on red and roe deer expansion is idiosyncratic.
Contrary to red deer, roe deer expansion was also influenced by climatic
conditions. We did not detect any significant effect of human factors on
the red and roe deer expansion.
Main conclusions: The synergistic effects between variables should be
taken into account when studying the patterns of species expansion. Our
study emphasize that policy makers should consider the spatial,
temporal, ecological and societal nuances of species expansion in order
to prioritize management measures and to allocate management budgets.
Although concerted strategies to curtail species spread should mitigate
red and roe deer economic and ecological impacts, these effects can be
neutralized by a continuous rural exodus and the consequent forest and
shrub encroachment.},

abstract = {A central goal of comparative phylogeography is to understand how
species-specific traits interact with geomorphological history to govern
the geographic distribution of genetic variation within species. One key
biotic trait with an immense impact on the spatial patterns of
intraspecific genetic differentiation is dispersal. Here, we quantify
how species-specific traits directly related to dispersal affect genetic
variation in terrestrial organisms with adaptations for dispersal by
sea, not land-the mangroves of the Caribbean. We investigate the
phylogeography of white mangroves (Laguncularia racemosa, Combretaceae)
and red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Rhizophoraceae) using chloroplast
genomes and nuclear markers (thousands of RAD-Seq loci) from individuals
throughout the Caribbean. Both coastal tree species have viviparous
propagules that can float in salt water for months, meaning they are
capable of dispersing long distances. Spatially explicit tests of the
role of ocean currents on patterning genetic diversity revealed that
ocean currents act as a mechanism for facilitating dispersal, but other
means of moving genetic material are also important. We measured pollen-
vs. propagule-mediated gene flow and discovered that in white mangroves,
seeds were more important for promoting genetic connectivity between
populations, but in red mangroves, the opposite was true: pollen
contributed more. This result challenges our concept of the importance
of both proximity to ocean currents for moving mangrove seeds and the
extent of long-distance pollen dispersal. This study also highlights the
importance of spatially explicit quantification of both abiotic (ocean
currents) and biotic (dispersal) factors contributing to gene flow to
understand fully the phylogeographic histories of species.},

Recent introductions in Cairns, Australia have demonstrated slower than expected spatial spread. Potential reasons for this include: (i) barriers to Ae. aegypti dispersal; (ii) higher incidence of long-range dispersal; and (iii) intergenerational loss of Wolbachia. We investigated these three potential factors using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and an assay for the Wolbachia infection wMel in 161 Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns in 2015. We detected a small but significant barrier effect of Cairns highways on Ae. aegypti dispersal using distance-based redundancy analysis and patch-based simulation analysis. We detected a pair of putative full-siblings in ovitraps 1312 m apart, indicating long-distance female movement likely mediated by human transport. We also found a pair of full-siblings of different infection status, indicating intergenerational loss of Wolbachia in the field. These three factors are all expected to contribute to the slow spread of Wolbachia through Ae. aegypti populations, though from our results it is unclear whether Wolbachia loss and long-distance movement are sufficiently common to reduce the speed of spatial spread appreciably. Our findings inform the strategic deployment of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes during releases, and show how parameter estimates from laboratory studies may differ from those estimated using field data.

especially on small geographic scales. We performed a genetic analysis
of isolated island populations of the Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi)
on Tokunoshima Island using mitochondrial D-loop region sequences and 8
nuclear microsatellite markers. Using data from fecal samples, we
detected 2 genetic groups that corresponded with the northern and
southern forested areas of the island based on the mitochondrial and

nuclear genomes but did not detect gene flow between the 2 groups in the
mitochondrial genomes. Although genetic diversity was higher in the
southern population than in the northern population, the fixation index
showed higher levels of inbreeding in the southern area with a signal of
a recent bottleneck. We inferred the divergence time between the
northern and southern groups (similar to 4,320 years ago) using
approximate Bayesian computations. These genetic structure patterns may
have been generated by a combination of the demographic history of the
species in relation to the geology of the island, human activities in
the stone age, deforestation due to sugar plantations (beginning
approximately 300 years ago), and recent human activities. This study
highlights the importance of considering genetic structure in relation

issues and implementing a comprehensive program to reduce human-bear
conflicts (Ursus spp.; HBC) for 3 small, fragmented, and threatened
grizzly bear (U. arctos) populations in the trans-border region of
southwest Canada and northwest USA. We explored the temporal and spatial
patterns of conflict mortality and found that HBC contributed
significantly to the threatened status of these populations by causing
decline, fragmentation, and decreased habitat effectiveness. Our program
to reduce HBCs primarily included strategic private lands purchased to
reduce human density in wildlife corridors, the reduction of bear
attractants where human settlement and agriculture exists, and the
nonlethal management of conflict bears. Attractant management strategies
encompassed public education, cost-share electric fencing,
bear-resistant garbage containers, and deadstock containment. We taught
bear safety courses and bear spray training to increase tolerance and
give people tools to avoid negative encounters with bears. We
radio-collared and used nonlethal management on potential conflict bears
and have a similar to 75% success rate in that the bear was alive and
out of conflict situations over the life of the radio-collar. We
identified important backcountry grizzly bear foraging habitat for
motorized access control to reduce conflict and mortality and provide
habitat security to reproductive females. Ongoing monitoring has
demonstrated that our comprehensive HBC program has resulted in a
significant reduction in human-caused mortality, increased
inter-population connectivity, and improved habitat effectiveness.
Several challenges remain, however, including an increase in the numbers
of young grizzly bears living adjacent to agricultural areas. Herein we
discuss strategies for how to integrate conservation vision into future

abstract = {Variation in biological communities is a consequence of stochastic and
deterministic factors. Examining the relative importance of these
factors helps to understand variation in the whole biodiversity in a
region. We examined the roles of stochastic and deterministic factors in
structuring macroinvertebrate communities in high-latitude streams
across two seasons. We predicted that if communities are the result of
deterministic environmental filtering processes, the communities should
show strong association with environmental variables, as taxa would be
selected according to stream environmental conditions. However, if
communities are driven by stochastic factors, they should show strong
association with spatial variables, as the distribution of taxa in
communities would be driven by spatially related dispersal factors. We
studied these predictions by calculating the degree of uniqueness of the
streams in terms of their taxonomic and functional community
compositions and by modelling the resulting index values using spatial
and environmental variables. Our results supported the first prediction
where the communities are more influenced by the environmental filtering
processes, although indications of the effect of spatial processes in
structuring the communities were present especially in autumn.
High-latitude stream communities also seem to be sensitive to
environmental changes, as even small changes in environment were enough
to affect the ecological uniqueness of the streams. These findings
highlight the vulnerability of northern streams in the face of the
climate change. To maintain biodiversity in high-latitude catchments, it
would be important to protect varying habitat conditions, which are the
main forces affecting the ecological uniqueness of the streams.},

Matching the scales of patterns and putative processes is both a key to
success and a challenge.
2. We have developed a simple statistical approach, based on variogram
analysis, that identifies multiple spatial scales where the population
pattern, in this case genetic structure, have highest expression (i.e.
the spatial scales at which the strength of patterning of
isolation-by-distance (IBD) residual variance reached maximum) from
empirical data and, thus, at which scales it should be studied relative
to the underlying processes. The approach is applicable to any spatially
explicit pairwise data, including genetic, morphological or ecological
distance or similarity of individuals, populations and ecosystems. To
exemplify possible applications of this approach, we analysed
microsatellite genotypes of 1,530 brown bears from Sweden and Norway.
3. The variogram approach identified two scales at which population
structure was strongest, thus indicating two different scale-dependent
processes: home-range-related processes at scales <35km, and
subpopulation division at scales >98km. On the basis of this, we
performed a scale-explicit analysis of genetic structure using DResD
analysis and compared the results with those obtained by the Bayesian
clustering implemented in structure.

abstract = {Aim: The importance of quantifying the contribution of historical
processes in shaping current biodiversity patterns is now recognized,
but quantitative approaches that explicitly link speciation, extinction
and dispersal processes to palaeo-environmental changes are currently
lacking. Here, we propose a spatial diversification model of lineages
through time (SPLIT) based on the reconstruction of palaeo-environments.
We illustrate our approach using mangroves as a case study and evaluate
whether habitat changes caused by plate tectonics explain the current
biodiversity patterns of this group.
Innovations: The SPLIT model allows one to simulate the evolutionary
dynamics of species ranges by spatially linking speciation, extinction
and dispersal processes to habitat changes over geological time periods.
The SPLIT model provides a mechanistic expectation of speciation and
extinction assuming that species are ecologically identical and not
interacting. The likelihood of speciation and extinction is equivalent
across species and depends on two dispersal parameters interacting with
habitat dynamics (d a maximum dispersal distance and ds a distance
threshold beyond which gene flow is absent). Beyond classical
correlative approaches, this model tracks biodiversity dynamics under
palaeo-environmental changes and provides multiple expectations (i.e.,
alpha-, beta-diversity, phylogenies) that can be compared to empirical
patterns.
Main conclusions: The SPLIT model allows a better understanding of the
origin of biodiversity by explicitly accounting for habitat changes over
geological times. The simulations applied to the mangrove case study
reproduced the observed longitudinal gradient in species richness, the
empirical pattern of beta-diversity and also provided inference on
diversification rates. Future developments may include niche evolution
and species interactions to evaluate the importance of non-neutral
mechanisms. The method is fully implemented in the InsideDNA platform
for bioinformatics analyses, and all modelling results can be accessed

levels of genetic differentiation and potentially speciation. Previous
genetic analyses of closely related plovers Charadrius spp. found
strikingly different population genetic structure in Madagascar:
Kittlitz's plovers are spatially homogenous whereas white-fronted
plovers have well segregated and geographically distinct populations.
Here, we test the hypotheses that Kittlitz's plovers are spatially
interconnected and have extensive social interactions that facilitate
gene flow, whereas white-fronted plovers are spatially discrete and have
limited social interactions. By experimentally removing mates from
breeding pairs and observing the movements of mate-searching plovers in
both species, we compare the spatial behavior of Kittlitz's and
white-fronted plovers within a breeding season. The behavior of
experimental birds was largely consistent with expectations: Kittlitz's
plovers travelled further, sought new mates in larger areas, and
interacted with more individuals than white-fronted plovers, however
there was no difference in breeding dispersal. These results suggest
that mating strategies, through spatial behavior and social
interactions, are predictors of gene flow and thus genetic
differentiation and speciation. Our study highlights the importance of
using social behavior to understand gene flow. However, further work is

richness and area-corrected species richness were calculated for 28

southwest high-altitude areas than low areas. Consistently, the
area-corrected species richness increases with increasing altitude,
decreasing latitude, and decreasing longitude, as indicated by
regression analyses. China is rich in parasitic flora with a high
proportion of endemic species. Perennials and root hemiparasites are the

fragmentation effects if no prefragmentation genetic data are available.
We used microsatellite markers to investigate whether severe habitat
fragmentation may have affected the structure and diversity of
populations of the endangered Australian bird-pollinated shrub Grevillea
caleyi R.Br., by comparing current patterns of genetic structure and
diversity with those of the closely related G. longifolia R.Br. that has
a similar life history but has not experienced anthropogenic

substantial population subdivision at all spatial levels (global F-ST =
0.615 and 0.454; S-p = 0.039 and 0.066), marked isolation by distance
and large heterozygous deficiencies. These characteristics suggest
long-term effects of inbreeding in self-compatible species that have
poor seed dispersal, limited connectivity via pollen flow and undergo
population bottlenecks because of periodic fires. Highly structured
allele size distributions, most notably in G. caleyi, imply historical
processes of drift and mutation were important in isolated
subpopulations. Genetic diversity did not vary with population size but
was lower in more isolated populations for both species. Through this
comparison, we reject the hypothesis that anthropogenic fragmentation

caleyi populations. Our results suggest that highly self-compatible
species with limited dispersal may be relatively resilient to the
genetic changes predicted to follow habitat fragmentation.},

ecological contexts where the dispersion of organisms is not severely
limited, namely selection and ecological drift. This intuitive framework
has motivated a constant flow of empirical models for linking the
species matrix to the local environmental descriptors, in which the
environment rarely explains more than 30-40% of the variation in
species composition. In most cases, researchers only approximate the
environmental axes that drive fitness differences between species, as
the list of measured descriptors reflect both logistical constraints and
hypothesis-driven questions. Moreover, contextual factors, such as the
species pool size (SPS) and the spatial extent of the sampled area,
could moderate species-environment associations through sampling effects
and dispersal limitations. This study's objective was to quantify the
influence of contextual factors (i.e., related to the circumstances in
which the study was conducted) on the species-environment association
strength on the basis of a synthesis of 156 models of forest bird
communities. Our results reveal that factors related to the SPS and the
number of independent environmental axes studied affect our capacity to
detect selection, whereas spatial factors such as the study's spatial
extent and latitude are less important determinants. The study context
explains almost a third of the observed variation in the strength of the
species-environment association. We conclude that strong
species-environment associations can be found for properly designed

abstract = {QuestionDecreased above-ground biomass and subsequent changes in
resource availability exert a strong influence on seedling recruitment
in post-disturbance forests. Ecological trade-offs underlie recruitment
processes, as species vary in resource allocation, dispersal and stress
tolerance strategies. Functional traits that indicate resource
acquisition-conservation trade-offs include leaf N content, wood
density, maximum height, shade tolerance and drought tolerance, while
seed mass can indicate species' dispersal strategies. This study looks
for generality in post-disturbance trait responses, and asks whether
these responses are additionally constrained or amplified by disturbance
characteristics, climate and ecological provinces.
LocationEastern US temperate forests.
MethodsI leveraged a longitudinal, continental-scale database of
post-disturbance forests to examine recruitment dynamics. Using
multivariate, hierarchical Bayesian models, I examined how disturbance
affects the traits of seedling layer communities where recruitment
dynamics should be most evident, and compared this to undisturbed
communities. I also examined how the traits underlying trade-off axes
varied across disturbance properties, ecological provinces and climatic
gradients.
ResultsAll traits except leaf N showed significant, study-wide shifts in
disturbed communities consistent with expectations of post-disturbance
stands. In undisturbed plots, all traits had significant shifts in the
opposite direction to those observed in disturbed plots, except leaf N
and drought tolerance, where no change was observed. Disturbance
severity increased the magnitude of response of several, but not all,
trait responses in disturbed plots. The traits that had significant
shifts were idiosyncratic across ecological provinces, indicating unique
processes influencing disturbance responses across the system. Moreover,
while climate strongly correlated with all traits prior to disturbance
in the initial sampling periods, it was not correlated with disturbance
responses.
ConclusionsThis study demonstrates general, biome-wide trait shifts
towards resource acquisition and bet-hedging dispersal strategies in
post-disturbance forest seedling communities. At finer spatial scales,
the traits underlying these trade-offs varied, indicating that
disturbance-dependent species differ in life-history strategies across
the system. This variation across ecological provinces appears
independent of temperature and precipitation, suggesting that unmeasured
abiotic or biotic variables influence recruitment. Seedling recruitment
is critical in shaping future adult tree communities, and this study
reveals large-scale contingencies in trait patterns associated with this
process.},

abstract = {Synchronous population fluctuations occur in many species and have large
economic impacts, but remain poorly understood. Dispersal, climate and
natural enemies have been hypothesized to cause synchronous population
fluctuations across large areas. For example, insect herbivores cause
extensive forest defoliation and have many natural enemies, such as
parasitoids, that may cause landscape-scale changes in density. Between
outbreaks, parasitoid-caused mortality of hosts/herbivores is high, but
it drops substantially during outbreak episodes. Because of their
essential role in regulating herbivore populations, we need to include
parasitoids in spatial modelling approaches to more effectively manage
insect defoliation. However, classic host-parasitoid population models
predict parasitoid density, and parasitoid density is difficult to
relate to host-level observations of parasitoid-caused mortality. We
constructed a novel model to study how parasitoids affect insect
outbreaks at the landscape scale. The model represents metacommunity
dynamics, in which herbivore regulation, colonisation and extinction are
driven by interactions with the forest, primary parasitoids and
hyperparasitoids. The model suggests that parasitoid spatial dynamics
can produce landscape-scale outbreaks. Our results propose the testable
prediction that hyperparasitoid prevalence should increase just before
the onset of an outbreak because of hyperparasitoid overexploitation. If
verified empirically, hyperparasitoid distribution could provide a
biotic indicator that an outbreak will occur.},

coexisting with a limited potential for wind pollination, a hypothesis
we tested for C. ophiolitica in Central Queensland, Australia. Cones
were associated with three species of beetle: an undescribed weevil
(Curculionidae), Hapalips sp. (Erotylidae) and Ulomoides sp.
(Tenebrionidae). Pollination-vector exclusion experiments compared the
pollination success (quantified as % ovules pollinated per cone) of
control cones against bagged or netted cones that excluded wind or
insects respectively (n = 10 for all treatments). Insects do pollinate
C. ophiolitica in the absence of wind, the median (first quartile-third
quartile) pollination success of control plants being 83.7%
(60.8-87.2%) while bagged cones, from which wind, but not insects, were
excluded, pollinated at 52.9% (19.5-74.8%). For netted cones,
(excluding insects but not wind), pollination fell to 12.6%
(10.9-45.9%). Airborne pollen (as quantified by capture on a series of
adhesive pollen traps) decreased rapidly with distance from male cones,
potentially becoming ineffective for wind pollination at similar to 5 m.
Airborne pollen load in the vicinity of female cones, and distance of
females from neighbouring males, suggests wind pollination may occur
sporadically, but only at high spatial densities. Although Cycas appears
to be primarily insect pollinated, this limited potential for ambophily
may be significant given the history of dispersal and pollinator host
shifts among these cycads.},

abstract = {Most organisms in ephemeral habitat patches have resting stages which
form a local species pool in response to temporal variations in the
patch's availability and suitability. Temporal dispersal from the local
species pool may, therefore, be an important process shaping the
community assembly, particularly soon after patch creation, and possibly
interacting with environmental filtering. As the temporal variation of
the environmental conditions has a major effect on the composition of
the local species pool, we investigated how well contemporary conditions
(both patch availability and patch suitability) and temporal dispersal
(approximated by environmental temporal variation and temporal distance)
explain the changes in community composition in a given locality through
successive ephemeral habitat cycles. We used arable weeds in annual
crops as models. We calculated temporal weed community dissimilarity
indices between weed communities surveyed in cropping seasons at
intervals of two to eight years within a given field. The weeds were
surveyed twice each cropping season to account for any changes in the
relative contributions of temporal dispersal and contemporary conditions
during the season. Patch availability explained most of the temporal
weed dissimilarity, suggesting that patch dynamics have the greatest
effect on weed community assembly. Temporal distance and temporal
variation of the environmental conditions had more effect at the start
of the cropping season than later, while patch suitability had more
effect in the middle of the season. These results suggest that temporal
dispersal drives the weed community assembly when ephemeral habitat
patches are created. These assemblies are further shaped by
environmental filtering. This is consistent with a temporal source sink
dynamic mechanism where the seed bank acts as the main weed source.
However, a large part of temporal weed dissimilarity remains
unexplained, suggesting that other ecological processes such as spatial
dispersal and founder effect may also shape the weed community.},

abstract = {Aim Biogeographical processes underlying Indo-Pacific biodiversity
patterns have been relatively well studied in marine shallow water
invertebrates and fishes, but have been explored much less extensively
in seaweeds, despite these organisms often displaying markedly different
patterns. Using the marine red alga Portieria as a model, we aim to gain
understanding of the evolutionary processes generating seaweed
biogeographical patterns. Our results will be evaluated and compared
with known patterns and processes in animals. Location Indo-Pacific
marine region.
Methods Species diversity estimates were inferred using DNA-based
species delimitation methods. Historical biogeographical patterns were
inferred based on a six-gene time-calibrated phylogeny, distribution
data of 802 specimens, and probabilistic modelling of geographical range
evolution. The importance of geographical isolation for speciation was
further evaluated by population genetic analyses at the intraspecific
level. Results We delimited 92 candidate species, most with restricted
distributions, suggesting low dispersal capacity. Highest species
diversity was found in the Indo-Malay Archipelago (IMA). Our phylogeny
indicates that Portieria originated during the late Cretaceous in the
area that is now the Central Indo-Pacific. The biogeographical history
of Portieria includes repeated dispersal events to peripheral regions,
followed by long-term persistence and diversification of lineages within
those regions, and limited dispersal back to the IMA. Main conclusions
Our results suggest that the long geological history of the IMA played
an important role in shaping Portieria diversity. High species richness
in the IMA resulted from a combination of speciation at small spatial
scales, possibly as a result of increased regional habitat diversity
from the Eocene onwards, and species accumulation via dispersal and/or
island integration through tectonic movement. Our results are consistent
with the biodiversity feedback model, in which biodiversity hotspots act
as both ``centres of origin{''} and ``centres of accumulation,{''} and
corroborate previous findings for invertebrates and fish that there is
no single unifying model explaining the biological diversity within the
IMA.},

abstract = {Context The toxic cane toad (Rhinella marina) has invaded over 50
countries and is a serious conservation issue in Australia. Because the
cane toad has taken several decades to colonise northern Australia, due
to the large size of the continent and the east-west invasion axis,
there is scope for making testable predictions about how toads will
invade new areas. The western toad invasion front is far from linear,
providing clear evidence for heterogeneity in invasion speed.
Aims Several ad hoc hypotheses have been offered to explain this
heterogeneity, including the evolution of traits that could facilitate
dispersal, and spatial heterogeneity in climate patterns. Here an
alternative hypothesis is offered, and a prediction generated for the
spatiotemporal pattern of invasion into the Kimberley Region - the next
frontier for the invading toads in Australia.
Methods Using observations of spatiotemporal patterns of cane toad
colonisation in northern Australia over the last 15 years, a conceptual
model is offered, based on the orientation of wet season river flows
relative to the invasion axis, as well as toad rafting and floating
behaviour during the wet season.
Key results Our model predicts that toads will invade southern areas
before northern areas; an alternative model based on rainfall amounts
makes the opposite prediction. The models can now be tested by
monitoring the spread of invasion front over the next 5-10 years.
Conclusions Our conceptual models present a pleuralistic approach to
understanding the spatiotemporal invasion dynamics of toads; such an
approach and evaluation of the models could prove useful for managing
other invasive species.
Implications Although control of cane toads has largely proved
ineffective, knowledge of the spatiotemporal pattern of the toad
invasion in the Kimberley could: (1) facilitate potential management
tools for slowing the spread of toads; (2) inform stakeholders in the
local planning for the invasion; (3) provide researchers with a temporal
context for quantifying toad impacts on animal communities; and (4)
reveal the mechanism(s) causing the heterogeneity in invasion speed.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the consequences of spatial structure on ecological
dynamics is a central theme in ecology. Recently, research has
recognised the relevance of river and river-analogue network structures,
because these systems are not only highly diverse but also rapidly
changing due to habitat modifications or species invasions.
2. Much of the previous work on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in
metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic river networks has been
either using comparative approaches or was purely theoretical. However,
the use of microcosm experiments provides the unique opportunity to
study large-scale questions in a causal and experimental framework.
3. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments, in which we
manipulated the spatially explicit network configuration of a landscape
and addressed how linear versus dendritic connectivity affects
population dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of population
densities, and movement behaviour of the protist model organism
Tetrahymena pyriformis. We tracked population densities and
individual-level movement behaviour of thousands of individuals over
time.
4. At the end of the experiment, we found more variable population
densities between patches in dendritic networks compared to linear
networks, as predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic networks,
population densities were higher at nodes that connected to headwaters
compared to the headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in the
network. These differences follow theoretical predictions and emerged
from the different network topologies per se. These differences in
population densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent movement.
5. We show that differences in network structure alone can cause
characteristic spatial variation in population densities. While such
differences have been postulated by theoretical work and are the
underlying precondition for differential dispersal evolution in
heterogeneous networks, our results may be the first experimental
demonstration thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics may
affect extinction risks and can upscale to previously shown
metacommunity level diversity dynamics. Given that many species in
natural river systems exhibit strong spatiotemporal patterns in
population densities, our work suggests that abundance patterns should
not only be addressed from a local environmental perspective, but may be
the outcome of processes that are inherently driven by the respective
habitat network structure.},

recruitment is a key strategy for fisheries management and ecological
restoration. We evaluated variation in Ostrea chilensis recruitment
across seasons and sites over 4-6 yr in Foveaux Strait (New Zealand) to
infer the relative importance of determinants of population recruitment.
Recruitment varied significantly between seasons (p < 0.001). Most
recruitment in any given year (97.8 +/- 0.9%, mean +/- SE) occurred in
the austral spring and summer (November to February). Recruitment also
varied significantly between years (p < 0.001). In a separate
fishery-wide study, we investigated the effect of spawner densities on
recruitment, relative to other climatic and biological factors. We
deployed spat collectors at 6 sites across 3 discrete fishery areas, and
estimated densities of spawning-sized oysters from dredge samples. We
modelled counts of oyster spat and spawners with a negative binomial
regression to evaluate the stock-recruitment relationship. Recruitment
varied between years (50.8% of the deviance explained), spawner
densities (13.8%), and areas (11.6%), with further 2-way interactions
among these factors. Importantly, our analysis showed a continued
decline in recruits per spawner, despite similar or increasing densities
of spawning-sized oysters. Average recruitment for 2010-11 when spawner
densities were highest was 4.6% of the level observed in 2007-08. Our
data suggest that factors other than densities of oysters play a major
role in the numbers of competent larvae available for settlement.
Managing oyster fisheries as a single stock and maintaining oyster
densities above management reference points alone may not be sufficient
to ensure recruitment to rebuild populations.},

abstract = {The outcome of species interactions may manifest differently at
different spatial scales; therefore, our interpretation of observed
interactions will depend on the scale at which observations are made.
For example, in ladybeetle-aphid systems, the results from small-scale
cage experiments usually cannot be extrapolated to landscape-scale field
observations. To understand how ladybeetle-aphid interactions change
across spatial scales, we evaluated predator-prey interactions in an
experimental system. The experimental habitat consisted of 81 potted
plants and was manipulated to facilitate analysis across four spatial
scales. We also simulated a spatially explicit metacommunity model
parallel to the experiment. In the experiment, we found that the
negative effect of ladybeetles on aphids decreased with increasing
spatial scales. This pattern can be explained by ladybeetles strongly
suppressing aphids at small scales, but not colonizing distant patches
fast enough to suppress aphids at larger scales. In the experiment, the
positive effects of aphids on ladybeetles were strongest at three-plant
scale. In a model scenario where predators did not have demographic
dynamics, we found, consistent with the experiment, that both the
effects of ladybeetles on aphids and the effects of aphids on
ladybeetles decreased with increasing spatial scales. These patterns
suggest that dispersal was the primary cause of ladybeetle population
dynamics in our experiment: aphids increased ladybeetle numbers at
smaller scales because ladybeetles stayed in a patch longer and
performed area-restricted searches after encountering aphids; these
behaviors did not affect ladybeetle numbers at larger spatial scales.
The parallel experimental and model results illustrate how predator-prey
interactions can change across spatial scales, suggesting that our
interpretation of observed predator-prey dynamics would differ if
observations were made at different scales. This study demonstrates how
studying ecological interactions at a range of scales can help link the
results of small-scale ecological experiments to landscape-scale
ecological problems.},

abstract = {The transport phase of the animal-mediated plant dispersal process is critical to dispersal effectiveness as it determines the spatial distribution of the diaspores released and their chance for further recruitment. Assessing this specific phase of the dispersal process generally requires combining diaspore retention times with the associated distances covered. Here, we specifically tested the effect of grooming behavior, interindividual contacts and ungulate fur on diaspore retention times and associated dispersal distances for the hooked diaspores of Xanthium strumarium L. experimentally attached to tamed individuals of three ungulate species. We used a comparative approach based on differing fur quality on different body zones of these three ungulates. During 6-hr sessions, we monitored for grooming and social interactions that may induce intended or inadvertent diaspore detachment. Additionally, we proposed innovative approaches to directly assessing diaspore dispersal distances by red deer in situ. Fat-tailed functions fitted diaspore retention time, highlighting the potential for long-distance dispersal events. The longer the hair, the higher the retention capacity of diaspores in the animal's fur. As predicted, donkey retained diaspores longer than red deer and dwarf goat; and we also confirmed that diaspores attached to the short hair of the head fell off more quickly than did those on the other body zones. Dwarf goat groomed more often than both red deer and donkey, but also when it carried diaspores. Up to 14% of the diaspores detached from animal fur after specific grooming behavior. We observed, in controlled conditions, for the first time and for each ungulate species, interindividual transfers of diaspores, representing 5% of the diaspores attached to animals' fur. Our results militate for incorporating animal behavior into plant dispersal modeling approaches.},

abstract = {White-nose syndrome (WNS), affecting multiple North American bat species
during the hibernation period, is a highly pathogenic disease caused by
the psychrophilic fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Because the
fungal pathogen persists in the hibernation site environment
independently of the hosts, previous theory on spatial disease dynamics
cannot predict WNS epidemics. However, the ability to understand factors
contributing to the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in North America
is crucial to the management of infected and susceptible bat populations
as well as the conservation of threatened and endangered bat species.
Utilizing recent theory on environmental opportunistic pathogens, we
modelled the effect of (a) landscape clustering, (b) environmental
conditions in hibernacula and (c) microbial competition on the spread of
WNS. We used available, already published data to construct and
parameterize our model, which takes into account the spatial
distribution of hibernation sites, temperature conditions in both the
outside ambient and hibernation site environment, bat population
dynamics, dispersal and infection by the pathogen, which also has its
host-independent dynamics with the environment. We also consider the
effect of outside-host competition between the pathogen and other
micro-organisms on spatial disease dynamics. Our model suggests that
pathogen loads accumulate in poorly connected hibernacula at short host
dispersal, which can help found the epidemic. In contrast, invasion of
the landscape is most successful at long host dispersal distances, with
homogenous hibernation site distribution and heterogeneous
between-hibernation site temperatures. Also, increasing the mean
temperature across hibernacula increases fungal growth rate, leading to
higher disease prevalence and faster invasion rate. Increasing spatial
heterogeneity in hibernaculum temperatures results in the formation of
disease hotspots in warmer hibernacula, facilitating more effective
spread of the disease in the landscape. Cold-adapted competing microbes
can prevent invasion, and therefore, overwintering in cold hibernacula
increases probability of host survival. Sites that were suboptimal for
overwintering prior to WNS may have importance in preventing local
extirpations. Although the model is tailored for WNS, due to pressing
need for results that can assist in planning conservation measures,
these novel results can be broadly applied to other environmentally
transmitted diseases. A is available for this article.},

Transport infrastructure is a potential corridor for biological invasion, but processes underlying invasion of alien species from human settlements along transport networks are uncertain. We surveyed alien and native plant species and their functional traits in roadside vegetation in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. The site is unique because there is a single invasion source (i.e., town). Vegetation, environmental and spatial factors were measured in 362 quadrats on two transects established along roads. Mean species richness within each quadrat (taxonomic alpha-diversity) was higher for alien assemblages, whereas mean functional richness (functional alpha-diversity) was higher for native assemblages. Alien species shared similar traits as generalists, which show lower functional diversity than specialists. Functional alpha-diversity of alien assemblages decreased with increasing distance from the source town, and the nestedness-resultant component of functional beta-diversity of alien assemblages accounted for a relatively high proportion of their total functional beta-diversity. Alien species with high dispersal ability were widely distributed, whereas other alien species were still limited to areas adjacent to the human settlement. Alien species showed a greater probability of having seed floss, lower percentage of perennial species, and lower seed dry mass than native species. Thus, alien species showed superior dispersal and competitive abilities compared with native species, and exclusion of all alien species is likely impractical. Consideration of functional traits may aid selection of alien species of particular concern for implementation of control and extermination measures.},

Network analysis based on graph theory was used to examine how

concentrated in a single large cluster, which was connected to other
habitat concentrations via corridors of ``stepping stone{''} patches. A
small number of ``keystone patches{''}, whose loss would have a
disproportionately large effect on overall connectivity, were also
identified. The locations of the major corridors were relatively

scales is becoming evident with extensive molecular studies. Such
observations suggest isolation at small scales may play an important
role in forming patterns of genetic diversity within species.
Isolation-by-distance, isolation-by-environment and historical priority
effects are umbrella terms for a suite of processes that underlie
genetic structure, but their relative importance at different spatial
and temporal scales remains elusive. Here, we use marine lakes in
Indonesia to assess genetic structure and assess the relative roles of
the processes in shaping genetic differentiation in populations of a
bivalve mussel (Brachidontes sp.). Marine lakes are landlocked
waterbodies of similar age (6,000-10,000 years), but with heterogeneous
environments and varying degrees of connection to the sea. Using a
population genomic approach (double-digest restriction-site-associated
DNA sequencing), we show strong genetic structuring across populations
(range F-ST: 0.07-0.24) and find limited gene flow through admixture
plots. At large spatial scales (>1,400 km), a clear
isolation-by-distance pattern was detected. At smaller spatial scales
(<200 km), this pattern is maintained, but accompanied by an association
of genetic divergence with degree of connection. We hypothesize that
(incomplete) dispersal barriers can cause initial isolation, allowing
priority effects to give the numerical advantage necessary to initiate
strong genetic structure. Priority effects may be strengthened by local
adaptation, which the data may corroborate by showing a high correlation
between mussel genotypes and temperature. Our study indicates an
often-neglected role of (evolution-mediated) priority effects in shaping

potential downstream impact on the estimation of genetic parameters.
3. With empirical data, we found that sample size and timing of sampling
strongly affected the accuracy of allele frequencies and the downstream
analyses, while sex ratio did not. Our results were consistent across
spatial and temporal replicates. Also, with simulated data, we showed
that the genetic sampling design had limited effect in systems where
dispersal outweighs genetic drift, while it can have major consequences
on our understanding of the genetic diversity and population
differentiation in systems dominated by genetic drift (such as most
study systems with conservation concerns).
4. We advocate for careful consideration of all aspects of the sampling
design in population genetics studies, that is a sufficient number of
samples, while ensuring similar sex ratio among sampling locations and
collecting with timing appropriate to the question under study. This is
particularly important when the study aims at species conservation.},

surface. However, knowledge about how animals use and move through these
landscapes is limited, especially for small and cryptic taxa, such as
reptiles and amphibians. We aimed to understand the influence of land
use on reptile and frog movement in a fine-grained grazing landscape. We
surveyed reptiles and frogs using pitfall and funnel traps in transects
located in five land use types: 1) woodland remnants, 2) grazed
pastures, 3) coarse woody debris added to grazed pastures, 4) fences in
grazed pastures and 5) linear plantings within grazed pastures. We found
that the different land cover types influenced the types and distances
moved by different species and groups of species. Reptiles moved both
within, and out of, grazed paddocks more than they did in woodland
remnants. In contrast, frogs exhibited varying movement behaviours. The
smooth toadlet (Uperoleia laevigata) moved more often and longer
distances within remnants than within paddocks. The spotted marsh frog
(Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) moved out of grazed pastures more than out
of pastures with coarse woody debris added or fences and were never
recaptured in plantings. We found that most recaptured reptiles and
frogs (76.3%) did not move between trapping arrays, which added to
evidence that they perceived most of the land cover types as habitat. We
suggest that even simple fences may provide conduits for movement in the
agricultural landscape for frogs. Otherwise, most reptile and frog
species used all land cover types as habitat, though of varying quality.
Reptiles appeared to perceive the woodland remnants as the highest
quality habitat. This landscape is fine-grained which may facilitate
movement and persistence due to high heterogeneity in vegetation cover
over short distances. Therefore, intensification and increasing the size
of human land use may have negative impacts on these taxa.},

rosalia, an endangered arboreal primate living in highly fragmented

loci to answer three questions: (1) How far does L. rosalia disperse?
(2) Is dispersal sex-biased? (3) What are the relative contributions of
population management, distance, roads and landscape resistance to
genetic kinship? We hypothesized that (1) gene flow decrease between
more distant sites; (2) males disperse more than females; and (3)
management and land-cover resistance (i.e. landscape resistance) are the
variables that most influence genetic kinship. We found positive spatial
population-structure up to 8 km. The spatial structure was similar
between females and males suggesting that they equally contribute to
gene flow. Management and landscape resistance best explained genetic
kinship, showing that different land-cover types affect the dispersal at
different degrees of landscape permeability. We advocate that
maintaining more permeable landscapes is essential to ensure dispersal

the degree at which each land use roads, urban areas, agriculture,

abstract = {Metapopulation ecology and landscape ecology aim to understand how
spatial structure influences ecological processes, yet these disciplines
address the problem using fundamentally different modeling approaches.
Metapopulation models describe how the spatial distribution of patches
affects colonization and extinction, but often do not account for the
heterogeneity in the landscape between patches. Models in landscape
ecology use detailed descriptions of landscape structure, but often
without considering colonization and extinction dynamics. We present a
novel spatially explicit modeling framework for narrowing the divide
between these disciplines to advance understanding of the effects of
landscape structure on metapopulation dynamics. Unlike previous efforts,
this framework allows for statistical inference on landscape resistance
to colonization using empirical data. We demonstrate the approach using
11 yr of data on a threatened amphibian in a desert ecosystem. Occupancy
data for Lithobates chiricahuensis (Chiricahua leopard frog) were
collected on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR), Arizona,
USA from 2007 to 2017 following a reintroduction in 2003. Results
indicated that colonization dynamics were influenced by both patch
characteristics and landscape structure. Landscape resistance increased
with increasing elevation and distance to the nearest streambed.
Colonization rate was also influenced by patch quality, with
semi-permanent and permanent ponds contributing substantially more to
the colonization of neighboring ponds relative to intermittent ponds.
Ponds that only hold water intermittently also had the highest
extinction rate. Our modeling framework can be widely applied to
understand metapopulation dynamics in complex landscapes, particularly
in systems in which the environment between habitat patches influences
the colonization process.},

abstract = {Aim Epiphytic plants are isolated from each other by nonhabitat canopy
elements and are thus expected to act as islands, the biodiversity of
their inhabitants (e.g., spiders) conforming to island biogeographic
predictions of species-richness patterns. Although it has been shown
that arthropod diversity decreases with decreasing epiphyte size, the
effects of isolation have not yet been addressed. We studied the joint
effect of isolation, spatial position, and size of epiphytic plants
(canopy islands) on species richness, relative rareness, and similarity
of spider communities. Location A shade-coffee plantation in central
Veracruz, Mexico. Taxon Spiders (Araneae), vascular epiphytes
(Bromeliaceae, Piperaceae, Orchidaceae, Araceae, Pteridophyta). Methods
We collected all canopy islands occurring on three trees and recorded
their three-dimensional spatial position. In the laboratory, we
disassembled the plants and collected all spiders present. We analysed
the effects of island size, isolation, and spatial position on the
species richness and the relative rareness of spider communities using
generalized linear models (GLM), on the distribution of different spider
guilds using a CCA, and on community composition using a permutational
multivariate analysis of variance (Permanova). Isolation and spatial
position were addressed using five distance measures representing
isolation from different potential species sources. We tested how the
similarity in spider community composition changed with the distance
between islands using Mantel correlograms.
Results As predicted by island biogeography theory, spider species
richness increased with canopy-island size and decreased with isolation.
In comparison to island size, the effect of isolation was weak, though
significant. Relative rareness was hardly affected by island size but
more by isolation. Compositional similarity was affected by island size
and decreased with increasing spatial distance up to ca. 4 m. Guilds
separated along the main CCA axes, this ordination being driven by
epiphyte size and position. Main conclusions Epiphytic plants behaved
like canopy islands in that their size and isolation influenced the
diversity and composition of spider communities. However, the effect of
isolation was only a fraction of that of island size, perhaps because
spatial relationships are taxon-specific. This may be due to differences
in hunting behaviour and dispersal capacities, for example, between
guilds of hunting and web-building spiders, which is a dimension
deserving more attention. For a better understanding of biogeographic
principles driving the diversity of canopy island inhabitants, further
research on this topic should include position and isolation, at scales
matching the mobility of different functional groups, as part of their
explanatory variables.},

theoretical expectations associated with the colonization of novel
ranges. However, comparatively few empirical studies address the genomic
outcomes accompanying the genome-wide consequences associated with the
range expansion process, particularly in recent or ongoing expansions.
Here, we assess two recent and distinct eastward expansion fronts of a
highly mobile carnivore, the coyote (Canis latrans), to investigate
patterns of genomic diversity and identify variants that may have been
under selection during range expansion. Using a restriction-associated
DNA sequencing (RADseq), we genotyped 394 coyotes at 22,935 SNPs and
found that overall population structure corresponded to their 19th
century historical range and two distinct populations that expanded
during the 20th century. Counter to theoretical expectations for
populations to bottleneck during range expansions, we observed minimal
evidence for decreased genomic diversity across coyotes sampled along
either expansion front, which is likely due to hybridization with other
Canis species. Furthermore, we identified 12 SNPs, located either within
genes or putative regulatory regions, that were consistently associated
with range expansion. Of these 12 genes, three (CACNA1C, ALK, and EPHA6)
have putative functions related to dispersal, including habituation to
novel environments and spatial learning, consistent with the
expectations for traits under selection during range expansion. Although
coyote colonization of eastern North America is well-publicized, this
study provides novel insights by identifying genes associated with
dispersal capabilities in coyotes on the two eastern expansion fronts.},

abstract = {Aim: Invasive species are of increasing global concern. Nevertheless,
the mechanisms driving further distribution after the initial
establishment of non-native species remain largely unresolved,
especially in marine systems. Ocean currents can be a major driver
governing range occupancy, but this has not been accounted for in most
invasion ecology studies so far. We investigate how well initial
establishment areas are interconnected to later occupancy regions to
test for the potential role of ocean currents driving secondary spread
dynamics in order to infer invasion corridors and the source-sink
dynamics of a non-native holoplanktonic biological probe species on a
continental scale.
Location: Western Eurasia.
Time period: 1980s-2016.
Major taxa studied: `Comb jelly' Mnemiopsis leidyi.
Methods: Based on 12,400 geo-referenced occurrence data, we reconstruct
the invasion history of M. leidyi in western Eurasia. We model ocean
currents and calculate their stability to match the temporal and spatial
spread dynamics with large-scale connectivity patterns via ocean
currents. Additionally, genetic markers are used to test the predicted
connectivity between subpopulations.
Results: Ocean currents can explain secondary spread dynamics, matching
observed range expansions and the timing of first occurrence of our
holoplanktonic non-native biological probe species, leading to invasion
corridors in western Eurasia. In northern Europe, regional extinctions
after cold winters were followed by rapid recolonizations at a speed of
up to 2,000 km per season. Source areas hosting year-round populations
in highly interconnected regions can re-seed genotypes over large
distances after local extinctions.
Main conclusions: Although the release of ballast water from container
ships may contribute to the dispersal of non-native species, our results
highlight the importance of ocean currents driving secondary spread
dynamics. Highly interconnected areas hosting invasive species are
crucial for secondary spread dynamics on a continental scale. Invasion
risk assessments should consider large-scale connectivity patterns and
the potential source regions of non-native marine species.},

environmental conditions. At both fishways, fish assemblage composition
differed between fishway exit and downstream river samples, yet
differences between exit and river samples were not associated with
hydrological variables related to the size and frequency of weir
drown-out events or water quality. Population structure of the most
abundant species (sea mullet, Mugil cephalus; 61% of fish samples) also
differed significantly among fishway exit and river habitats. A
low-level structure spanning the river channel downstream of one weir
was not associated with differences in fish assemblage composition
indicating that access to the fishway entrance (and therefore fishway
use) was not hindered by in-stream obstructions. Eight and seven species
(predominantly small-bodied species that migrate within freshwater
systems) were exclusively sampled in downstream river locations at the
vertical slot and fish lock fishways, respectively, indicating that
neither design was fully capable of facilitating the passage of the
local fish fauna. Further assessment over a broader range of
hydrological conditions will be necessary to determine if use of either
fishway by fish is affected by low flows. Coupled with evidence produced
from landscape-scale analysis of spatial and temporal variation in fish

sufficiently novel in its flexibility to capture a wide variety of
spatiotemporal processes including metapopulations and a range of
migratory patterns. It can accommodate different kinds of age
structures, forms of population growth, dispersal, nomadism and
migration, and alternative life-history strategies. Our objective was to
link three general elements common to all spatially structured
populations (space, time and movement) under a single mathematical
framework. To do this, we adopt a network modeling approach. The spatial
structure of a population is represented by a weighted and directed
network. Each node and each edge has a set of attributes which vary
through time. The dynamics of our network-based population is modeled
with discrete time steps. Using both theoretical and real-world
examples, we show how common elements recur across species with
disparate movement strategies and how they can be combined under a
unified mathematical framework. We illustrate how metapopulations,
various migratory patterns, and nomadism can be represented with this
modeling approach. We also apply our network-based framework to four
organisms spanning a wide range of life histories, movement patterns,

framework is provided, which can be applied to almost any spatially
structured population. This framework contributes to our theoretical
understanding of population dynamics and has practical management
applications, including understanding the impact of perturbations on

The purpose of this study was to elucidate potential soybean insect pest control measures by determining the relationships between pests and spiders, common generalist predators in agroecosystems, and field margin type and distance from the field (0-3 and 3-6 m). Both margin type and distance were significantly correlated with in-field pest abundance (both pooled and taxa-specific). Generally, pest abundance was negatively correlated with the presence of wooded field margins at both distances and could be due to cultural control as hedgerows provide similar ecosystem services in other cropping systems. Spider abundance and spider-pest spatial associations (an indication of potential predation events) within fields were positively correlated with wooded margins from 3 to 6 m, indicating that conservation biological control in addition to cultural control might be contributing to diminished pest abundance in fields with these margins. The lack of wooded margin influence from 0 to 3 m might indicate a need for a minimum wooded area before margins can become a source for within-field spider populations. Furthermore, the number of spider-pest spatial associations was greatest early in the season when pest abundance was lowest and pests were more likely to be spatially aggregated. These data indicate that growers might be able to maintain their field margins, particularly wooded areas, to maximize both potential cultural control and conservation biological control resources, particularly early in the growing season.},

accumulate and aggregate if information about resource abundance is
incomplete. Informed movement results in stable resource-consumer

analyses, we revealed that distinct plant neighborhood and individual
factors drive pollen dispersal at the intra-fruit scale. Variance in
pollen dispersal distances was greater for neighborhoods with higher
conspecific density, indicating that density dependent reproductive
patterns play a role at this scale. Additionally, both the diversity and
evenness of sires mediated by a single pollinator were affected by the
size of the mother tree, that is, larger mothers received pollen from a
less diverse, less even pool of sires per fruit. Pollinator body size
was not found to be a significant driver of pollen dispersal, indicating
that both small- and large-bodied pollinators were equally important
pollen dispersers at this scale. By exploring patterns of variation at

margins, ditches, road verges) in eight agricultural landscapes of
Northwest Germany. We mapped LLE, including hedges and tree rows, from
aerial images in a Geographic Information System, converted the maps
into raster layers, and assigned resistance values to the raster cells,
where all cells outside of LLE received infinite resistance and, thus,
represented barriers to dispersal. For all pairs of plots within study
areas, we calculated Jaccard similarity assuming that it was a proxy (or
correlate) of dispersal events between plots. Further, we calculated RD
and LCD of the network of LLE and ED between the plots. We modelled the
effects of distance metrics on community similarity using binomial
generalized linear mixed models.
ED was clearly the least suitable isolation metrics. Further, we found
that RD performed better than LCD at modelling Jaccard similarity.
Predictions varied markedly between the two distance metrics suggesting
that RD comprises additional information about the landscape beyond
spatial distance, such as the possible presence of multiple pathways
between plots. Cost surfaces with equal cell-level resistances for all
types of LLE performed better than more complex ones with
habitat-specific resistances. We conclude that RD is a highly suitable
measure of isolation or, inversely, connectivity for studying dispersal
processes of plants within habitat corridors. It is likely also suitable
for assessing landscape permeability in other landscape types with areal
habitats instead of narrow corridors. RD holds the potential to improve
assessments of isolation (or connectivity) for models of regional
population and meta-community dynamics.},

abstract = {Aim: The number of studies investigating the nestedness and turnover
components of beta diversity has increased substantially, but our
general understanding of the drivers of turnover and nestedness remains
elusive. Here, we examined the effects of species traits, spatial
extent, latitude and ecosystem type on the nestedness and turnover
components of beta diversity.
Location: Global. Time period: 1968-2017.
Major taxa studied: From bacteria to mammals.
Methods: From the 99 studies that partition total beta diversity into
its turnover and nestedness components, we assembled 269 and 259 data
points for the pairwise and multiple site beta-diversity metrics,
respectively. Our data covered a broad variation in species dispersal
type, body size and trophic position. The data were from freshwater,
marine and terrestrial realms, and encompassed geographical areas from
the tropics to near polar regions. We used linear modelling as a
meta-regression tool to analyse the data.
Results: Pairwise turnover, multiple site turnover and total beta
diversity all decreased significantly with latitude. In contrast,
multiple site nestedness showed a positive relationship with latitude.
Beta-diversity components did not generally differ among the realms. The
turnover component and total beta diversity increased with spatial
extent, whereas nestedness was scale invariant for pairwise metrics.
Multiple site beta-diversity components did not vary with spatial
extent. Surprisingly, passively dispersed organisms had lower turnover
and total beta diversity than flying organisms. Body size showed a
relatively weak relationship with beta diversity but had important
interactions with trophic position, thus also affecting beta diversity
via interactive effects. Producers had significantly higher average
pairwise turnover and total beta diversity than carnivores.
Main conclusions: The present results provide evidence that species
turnover, being consistently the larger component of total beta
diversity, and nestedness are related to the latitude of the study area
and intrinsic organismal features. We showed that two beta-diversity
components had generally opposing patterns with regard to latitude. We
highlight that beta-diversity partition may give additional insights
into the underlying causes of spatial variability in biotic communities
compared with total beta diversity alone.},

their heterogeneous distributions within their habitats and movement
from one location to the other are taken care of within the modeling
approach. When the homogeneous steady-states become unstable, the
solutions of the corresponding reaction-diffusion systems never approach
a stationary state rather exhibit an irregular nature with respect to
both space and/or time. Cross-diffusion terms are incorporated in a
system of reaction-diffusion equations to model the situation where
presence, absence, abundance of one species influence the movement of
another species and vice-versa. In this work, cross-diffusion is
considered in a prey-predator model with ratio-dependent functional
response along with the self-diffusion terms. After deriving the Turing
instability conditions in terms of cross-diffusion parameters, extensive
numerical simulations are carried out to study the effect of
cross-diffusion on the chaotic dynamics and stationary Turing patterns
generated in the system containing self-diffusion terms only.
Appropriate numerical tools are used to characterize the spatio-temporal
chaos. Route to spatio-temporal chaos and its disappearance are
discussed in detail. The chaotic dynamics of the self-diffusion model
may be suppressed leading to a stationary state or preserved depending
on the cross-diffusion coefficients. The stationary patches of both the
species generated in the Turing domain remain stationary but their
configurations may change due to the effect of density-dependent
cross-diffusion. On the other hand, stationary patches generated in the
Turing-Hopf domain change to spatio-temporal chaos for higher dispersal

arrangement (aggregation or fragmentation) of patches in space
influences the population dynamics of foraging organisms. One hypothesis
in agricultural ecology is that fine-grain spatial heterogeneity in
cropping (many small agricultural fields) should provide better pest
control than coarse-grain heterogeneity (few large agricultural fields);
this hypothesis has been proposed as an explanation for the increased
pest abundance associated with agricultural intensification. However,
empirical studies have found mixed support for this hypothesis, and
some, surprisingly, demonstrate a strong decrease in pest abundance with
increased crop aggregation. We developed a spatially explicit simulation
model of pest movement across an agricultural landscape to uncover basic
processes that could reduce pest abundance in landscapes with fewer,
larger fields. This model focuses on herbivore movement and does not
include predation effects or other biological interactions. We found
that field aggregation in the model led to severely reduced pest
densities and further discovered that this relationship was due to an
increased distance between fields and a decreased ``target area{''} in
more aggregated landscapes. The features that create a negative
relationship between aggregation and pest densities rely on crop
rotation and limited dispersal capabilities of the pests. These findings
help to explain seemingly counter-intuitive empirical studies and

abstract = {Spatial synchrony in population dynamics is a ubiquitous ecological phenomenon that can result from predator-prey interactions, synchronized environmental variation (Moran effects), or dispersal. Of these, dispersal historically has been the least well studied in natural systems, partly because of the difficulty in quantifying dispersal in situ. We hypothesized that dispersal routes of plankton were based on the major and consistent water current movements in Kentucky Lake, a large reservoir in western Kentucky, USA. Then, using 26-year time series collected at 16 locations, we used matrix regression techniques to test whether spatial heterogeneity in strengths of hypothesized dispersal predicted spatial patterns of synchrony of phytoplankton and zooplankton, thereby testing for evidence of dispersal as a possible mechanism of synchrony in this system. Nearly all taxa showed significant spatial synchrony that did not decline with increasing linear distance between locations. All taxa also showed substantial geographic structure in synchrony that was not explained by linear distance. Matrix regression revealed that our hypothesized matrix of dispersal pathways, which differed substantially from linear distance, was a significant predictor of spatial variability in synchrony in phytoplankton biomass, and Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia lumholtzi densities. Thus dispersal was a likely mechanism of synchrony for these taxa. Our hypothesized dispersal matrix was a significant predictor of spatial patterns of synchrony for these taxa even after accounting for numerous alternative possible mechanisms, including possible Moran effects through any of ten physical/abiotic constraints. Our findings indicate that statistically comparing hypothesized or measured dispersal pathway information to synchrony data via matrix regressions can provide valuable evidence for the importance of dispersal as a mechanism of spatial synchrony.},

recent discovery of a novel herbivore (Caloptilia triadicae) on invasive

demography and herbivory across the North American range of Triadica

variation. We found that leaf toughness corresponded to genetic
variation in Triadica, longitude, and mean temperature. Genetic
variation in Triadica was the strongest predictor of herbivore
abundance, especially for the early leaf mining stages, though herbivore
abundance also corresponded to longitude. Model variables did not
explain leaf damage, which was driven by interactions with late-stage
larvae. Trends in herbivore demography were not consistent with
previously reported geographic patterns of Triadica genetic variation
related to tannin defense, but were consistent with patterns revealed by
other studies of Triadica phenolic compounds and C:N, as well as low

distance and genetic distance were not significantly associated,
indicating that geographic location was not a barrier to migration.
These nine populations could be clustered depending on their level of
genetic diversity (high and low). The genetic diversity (Shannon's

spatial scales of 1 and 2km and negatively with orchard and vegetable at
0.5 and 1km. Genetic diversity was best predicted by the
grassland+orchard+vegetable model at a spatial scale of 1km. Based on

the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, which has been challenged by

favor aging and group benefits at the expense of reductions in
individual lifespans. Here we propose a new model without making such
assumptions. It considers that limited dispersal can generate, through
reduced gene flow, spatial segregation of individual organisms according
to lifespan. Individuals from subpopulations with shorter lifespan could
thus resist collapse in a growing population better than individuals
from subpopulations with longer lifespan, hence reducing lifespan
variability within species. As species that disperse less may form more
homogeneous subpopulations regarding lifespan, this may lead to a
greater capacity to maximize lifespan that generates viable
subpopulations, therefore creating negative associations between
dispersal capacity and lifespan across species. We tested our model with
individual-based simulations and a comparative study using empirical
data of maximum lifespan and natal dispersal distance in 26 species of
birds, controlling for the effects of genetic variability, body size,
and phylogeny. Simulations resulted in maximum lifespans arising from
lowest dispersal probabilities, and comparative analyses resulted in a
negative association between lifespan and natal dispersal distance, thus
consistent with our model. Our findings therefore suggest that the

magnitude of climate and land-use changes; species dispersal abilities;
competition with harmful socioeconomic activities for land use; the
number of threatened species to consider; and, relatedly, the available
budget to act. Here, we provide a unified framework that quantifies the
relative effects of those factors on conservation. We conducted an
area-scheduling work plan in order to identify sets of areas along time
in which the persistence expectancies of species are optimized. The
approach was illustrated using data of potential distribution of ten
nonvolant mammal species in Iberia Peninsula from current time up to
2080. Analyses were conducted considering possible setups among the
factors that are likely to critically impact conservation success: three
climate/land-use scenarios; four species' dispersal kernel curves; six
land-use layer types; and two planning designs, in which assessments
were made independently for each species, or joining all species in a
single plan. We identified areas for an array of investments levels
capable to circumvent the spatial conflicts with socioeconomic
activities. The effect of each factor on the estimated species
persistence scores was assessed using linear mixed models. Our results
evidence that conservation success is highly reliant on the resources
available to abate land-use conflicts. Nonetheless, under the same
investment levels, planning design and climate change were the factors
that most shaped species persistence scores. The persistence of five
species was especially affected by the sole effect of planning design

the most widely used frameworks to evaluate the contributions of species
sorting to metacommunity structure. In many cases, however, species are
also driven by spatial processes that are independent of environmental
heterogeneity (e.g., neutral dynamics). As such, spatial autocorrelation
can occur independently in both species (due to limited dispersal) and
the environmental data, leading to spurious correlations between species
distributions and the spatialized (i.e., spatially autocorrelated)
environment. In these cases, the method of variation partitioning may
present high Type I error rates (i.e., reject the null hypothesis more

diversity of the coral reefs in the Coral Triangle (CT) of the Indo-West
Pacific (IWP). Here, we investigate processes implicit to the Centre of
Origin, Centre of Overlap and Centre of Survival hypotheses. We focus on
intraspecific genetic data, where intraspecific diversity can provide
information regarding directionality of past dispersal (gene flow) and
changes in population size such as expansion from refugia.
LocationIndian Ocean, Coral Triangle and West Pacific Ocean.
MethodsWe use existing mitochondrial DNA data augmented with new samples
from the Philippines, thus filling in key sampling gaps from previous
studies, to examine nine reef species. We first test if genetic
diversity peaks in the CT. We then estimate gene flow between regionsCT
vs. Indian Ocean (IO) and CT vs. Pacific Ocean (PO)to assess concordance
with predicted directions of movement (i.e. into the CT or out of the
CT). Finally, we investigate the historical demography of these species
and evaluate population expansions to ascertain whether genetic
diversity is correlated with putative Pleistocene refugia.
ResultsGenetic diversity in the CT was not greater than genetic
diversity in the IO and PO, and we found highly variable spatial
patterns of genetic diversity when species were evaluated individually.
Gene flow estimates indicated very limited exchange between regions,
consistent with peripheral isolation and/or signals of historical
divergence. For some species, however, there were signals of movement
out of the CT. While there was no significant correlation between
genetic diversity and putative refugia, genetic patterns suggested that
some populations have experienced population expansions. The locations
of expansion were also variable across species. Overall, there was no
signal of concordant processes shaping intraspecific genetic diversity.
Main conclusionsGenetic patterns across species were highly variable
with some species lending weak support for processes aligned with each
of the Centre of diversity hypotheses. But overall there was no
compelling evidence for uniform processes underlying all species, which
possibly indicate that processes underlying the different Centre have
not strongly affected IWP species within the recent past.},

abstract = {We examined spatial and environmental effects on the deconstructed
assemblages of littoral macroinvertebrates within a large lake. We
deconstructed assemblages by three biological trait groups: body size,
dispersal mode and oviposition behaviour. We expected that spatial
effects on assemblage structuring decrease and environmental effects
increase with increasing body size. We also expected stronger
environmental filtering and weaker spatial effect on the assemblages of
flying species compared with assemblages of non-flying species. Stronger
effect of environmental filtering was expected on the assemblages with
species attaching eggs compared with assemblages of species with free
eggs. We used redundancy analysis with variation partitioning to examine
spatial and environmental effects on the deconstructed assemblages. As
expected, the importance of environmental filtering increased and that
of spatial effects decreased with increasing body size. Opposite to our
expectations, assemblages of non-flying species were more affected by
environmental conditions compared to assemblages of flying species.
Concurring with our expectations, the importance of environmental
filtering was higher in structuring assemblages of species attaching
eggs than in structuring those with freely laid eggs. The amount of
unexplained variation was higher for assemblages with small-sized to
medium-sized species, flying species and species with free eggs than
those with large-sized species, non-flying species and species with
attached eggs. Our observations of decreasing spatial and increasing
environmental effects with increasing body size of assemblages deviated
from the results of previous studies. These results suggest differing
metacommunity dynamics between within-lake and among-lake levels and
between studies covering contrasting taxonomic groups and body size
ranges.},

4. The degree of between-plant turnover in the endophyte community was
inversely related to host plant inbreeding and average plant size and
positively related to the relative abundance of A. fulva. Plant size was
inversely related to endophyte community richness, both among and within

abstract = {1. Patterns that maintain and generate biodiversity of macro-organisms
in the Neotropics are widely discussed in the scientific literature, yet
the spatial ecology of micro-organisms is largely unknown. The unique
character of the tropical Andes and adjacent Amazon lowlands generates a
wide gradient of environmental conditions to advance our understanding
of what drives community assembly and diversity processes.
2. We analysed the distribution patterns of benthic diatoms (unicellular
siliceous algae) as a model group of microbial passive dispersers,
including predictors that describe limnological and geo-climatic
gradients for a total of 113 waterbodies (0-28 degrees S and 58-80
degrees W), including lakes and streams. Complementary multivariate
statistical analyses were performed to correlate (1) community
composition and (2) diatom species richness with environmental and
spatial factors to infer niche-based and dispersal-based assembly
processes, respectively.
3. Results showed that two gradients structured both diatom assemblages
and waterbodies, namely climate and landscape configuration. Variance
partitioning revealed that broadscale spatial variables (distance-based
Moran's Eigenvectors) outperformed the two environmental components
(limnological and geo-climatic), suggesting dispersal-assembled
communities. However, diatom assemblages were structured by geo-climatic
(regional) factors in certain lakes in the northern and central Andes,
although their effects were partially manifested via local variables
after the geographical distances were factored out. In a similar way,
climatic and topographic structuring homogenized lake and stream
communities within ecoregions, as indicated by the strong overlap
between the two community types and the weak correlation between biota
and limnological variables. Notably, a significant increase in diatom
species richness was related to increased water connectivity,
interpreted to indicate that a decrease in the remoteness of the system
increase species number.
4. Synthesis. We emphasize the strength of macroecological gradients
(landscape configuration and climatic factors) in affecting both diatom
diversity and community composition in the South American tropics. In
this context, our results and the commonalities of ecoregion patterning
with groups of macro-organisms (vegetation) suggest the need to
integrate microbial ecology into a macroecology framework to unravel
mechanisms behind diversity gradients.},

abstract = {Animals co-occurring in a region (sympatry) may use the same habitat
(syntopy) within that region. A central aim in ecology is determining
what factors drive species distributions (i.e., abiotic conditions,
dispersal limitations, and/or biotic interactions). Assessing the degree
of biotic interactions can be difficult for species with wide ranges at
sea. This study investigated the spatial ecology of two sea turtle
species that forage on benthic invertebrates in neritic GoM waters:
Kemp's ridleys (Lepidochelys kempii) and loggerheads (Caretta caretta).
We used satellite tracking and modeled behavioral modes, then calculated
individual home ranges, compared foraging areas, and determined extent
of co-occurrence. Using six environmental variables and principal
component analysis, we assessed similarity of chosen foraging sites. We
predicted foraging location (eco-region) based on species, nesting site,
and turtle size. For 127 turtles (64 Kemp's ridleys, 63 loggerheads)
tracked from 1989 to 2013, foraging home ranges were nine to ten times
larger for Kemp's ridleys than for loggerheads. Species intersected off
all U.S. coasts and the Yucatan Peninsula, but co-occurrence areas were
small compared to species' distributions. Kemp's ridley foraging home
ranges were concentrated in the northern GoM, whereas those for
loggerheads were concentrated in the eastern GoM. The two species were
different in all habitat variables compared (latitude, longitude,
distance to shore, net primary production, mean sea surface temperature,
and bathymetry). Nesting site was the single dominant variable that
dictated foraging ecoregion. Although Kemp's ridleys and loggerheads may
compete for resources, the separation in foraging areas, significant
differences in environmental conditions, and importance of nesting
location on ecoregion selection (i.e., dispersal ability) indicate that
adult females of these species do not interact greatly during foraging
and that dispersal and environmental factors more strongly determine
their distributions. These species show sympatry in this region but
evidence for syntopy was rare.},

Intraspecific genetic variation showed no detectable relationship with

interactions within and among nectar yeasts, a full spectrum of the
genotypic and phenotypic diversity observed across the 200-km coastline
was represented even at a scale as small as 200 m. Further, more
competitive strains were not necessarily more abundant. These results

abstract = {Theoretical analyses of single-species models have revealed that the
degree of synchrony in fluctuations of geographically separated
populations increases with increasing spatial covariation in
environmental fluctuations and increased interchange of individuals, but
decreases with local strength of density dependence. Here we extend
these results to include interspecific competition between two species
as well as harvesting. We show that the effects of interspecific
competition on the geographical scale of population synchrony are
dependent on the pattern of spatial covariation of environmental
variables. If the environmental noise is uncorrelated between the
competing species, competition generally increases the spatial scale of
population synchrony of both species. Otherwise, if the environmental
noises are strongly correlated between species, competition generally
increases the spatial scale of population synchrony of at least one, but
also often of both species. The magnitude of these spatial scaling
effects is, however, strongly influenced by the dispersal capacity of
the two competing species. If the species are subject to proportional
harvesting, this may synchronise population dynamics over large
geographical areas, affecting the vulnerability of harvested species to
environmental changes. However, the strength of interspecific
competition may strongly modify this effect of harvesting on the spatial
scale of population synchrony. For example, harvesting of one species
may affect the spatial distribution of competing species that are not
subject to harvesting. These analytical results provide an important
illustration of the importance of applying an ecosystem rather than a
single-species perspective when developing harvest strategies for a
sustainable management of exploited species.},

abstract = {Aim: The local- and regional-based forms of anthropogenic change
reducing grassland diversity are generally identified, but these
scale-dependent processes tend to co-occur with unclear interactive
effects. Here, we explicitly test how common local and regional
perturbations simultaneously affect plant alpha and beta diversity in a
multiyear community assembly experiment using fragments of grassland
habitat of various sizes. We hypothesized that local disturbances and
decreasing patch size would interact, suppressing local diversity while
homogenizing composition among patches.
Location: North America.
Methods: We conducted a three-year grassland assembly experiment,
factorially manipulating local perturbation (nitrogen addition and
mowing) and patch area for 36 patches over 13ha. We quantified the
individual and interactive effects of these local and regional factors
on plant alpha and beta diversity within (quadrat scale) and among
patches (patch scale). We also used a null model approach to disentangle
between stochastic- and niche-based assembly mechanisms.
Results: We detected a gradient of assembly outcomes driven by two
non-interacting factorsthe effects of N fertilization on alpha
(negative) and beta (positive) diversity regardless of spatial scale and
the scale-dependant effect of increasing patch size on alpha (positive)
and beta (positive) diversity. These effects unfolded over time, with
the constraints on richness and composition shifting from
dispersal-based during the first sampling year to perturbation-and
size-based factors at year two and three. Fertilization effects were
driven by a mixture of deterministic (i.e., selection at the species
level) and stochastic (i.e., random extinctions) processes resulting in
a decline in local richness but an increase in spatial heterogeneity in
species composition. Area appeared to influence alpha diversity mainly
via stochastic ``sampling effect{''}-larger patches represented a larger
sample of the regional pool. Niche-based processes, however, led to
convergence in beta diversity among smaller patches driving a positive
overall effect of area on beta diversity.
Main conclusion: Our results illustrate how diversity regulation in
contemporary grasslands can be simultaneously shaped by local and
regional factors acting additively but via contrasting assembly
mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {BackgroundGrazed grassland management regimes can have various effects
on soil fauna. For example, effects on earthworms can be negative
through compaction induced by grazing animals, or positive mediated by
increases in sward productivity and cattle dung pats providing a food
source. Knowledge gaps exist in relation to the behaviour of different
earthworm species i.e. their movement towards and aggregation under dung
pats, the legacy effects of pats and the spatial area of recruitment.
The present study addressed these knowledge gaps in field experiments,
over 2years, using natural and simulated dung pats on two permanent,
intensively grazed pastures in Ireland.ResultsDung pats strongly
affected spatial earthworm distribution, with up to four times more
earthworms aggregating beneath pats, than in the control locations away
from pats. In these earthworm communities comprising 11 species,
temporally different aggregation and dispersal patterns were observed,
including absence of individual species from control locations, but no
clear successional responses. Epigeic species in general, but also
certain species of the anecic and endogeic groups were aggregating under
dung. Sampling after complete dung pat disappearance (27weeks after
application) suggested an absence of a dung pat legacy effect on
earthworm communities. Based on species distributions, the maximum size
of the recruitment area from which earthworms moved to pats was
estimated to be 3.8m(2) per dung pat. Since actual grazing over 6weeks
would result in the deposition of about 300 dung pats per ha, it is
estimated that a surface area of 1140m(2) or about 11% of the total
grazing area can be influenced by dung pats in a given grazing
period.ConclusionsThis study showed that the presence of dung pats in
pastures creates temporary hot spots in spatial earthworm species
distribution, which changes over time. The findings highlight the
importance of considering dung pats, temporally and spatially, when
sampling earthworms in grazed pastures. Published comparisons of grazed
and cut grasslands probably reached incorrect conclusions by ignoring or
deliberately avoiding dung pats. Furthermore, the observed intense
aggregation of earthworms beneath dung pats suggests that earthworm
functions need to be assessed separately at these hot spots.},

contributions to the fields of population dynamics and invasion biology.
2. The invasion of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) is well-documented from
its introduction near Boston, Massachusetts USA in 1869 to its current
extent of over 900,000 km(2) in Eastern North America. Over the past two
decades, the USDA Forest Service Slow the Spread (STS) programme for
managing the future spread of gypsy moth has produced unrivalled
spatiotemporal data across the invasion front.
3. The STS programme annually deploys a grid of 60,000-100,000
pheromone-baited traps, currently extending from Minnesota to North
Carolina. The data from this programme have provided the foundation for
investigations of complex population dynamics and the ability to examine
ecological hypotheses previously untestable outside of theoretical
venues, particularly regarding invasive spread and Allee effects.
4. This system provides empirical data on the importance of
long-distance dispersal and time-lags on population establishment and
spatial spread. Studies showing high rates of spatiotemporal variation
of the range edge, from rapid spread to border stasis and even
retraction, highlight future opportunities to test mechanisms that
influence both invasive and native species ranges.
5. The STS trap data have also created a unique opportunity to study
low-density population dynamics and quantify Allee effects with
empirical data. Notable contributions include evidence for
spatiotemporal variation in Allee effects, demonstrating empirical links
between Allee effects and spatial spread, and testing mechanisms of
population persistence and growth rates at range edges.
6. There remain several outstanding questions in spatial ecology and
population biology that can be tested within this system, such as the
scaling of local ecological processes to large-scale dynamics across
landscapes. The gypsy moth is an ideal model of how important ecological
questions can be answered by thinking more broadly about monitoring
data.},

crucial ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal. The immediate
ecological consequences may include alteration or even collapse of
seed-mediated gene flow affecting plant population connectivity, with
impacts on the regional scale distribution of genetic variation. Yet,
these far-reaching consequences of defaunation remain understudied.
Here, we tested whether human-induced defaunation of the Canarian
frugivorous lizards (Gallotia, Lacertidae) altered within-island
population connectivity and the amount and large-scale distribution of
genetic variation of Neochamaelea pulverulenta (Rutaceae), which relies
exclusively on these lizards for seed dispersal. Our study system
defines a lizard downsizing gradient with three contrasted ecological
scenarios (islands) with relatively optimal (Gran Canaria; large-sized
lizards), suboptimal (Tenerife; medium) and collapsed seed dispersal
processes (La Gomera; small). We extensively sampled individual plant
genotypes from 80 populations spanning the full geographical range of
the plant to examine their genetic diversity, population-genetic network
topologies, and the patterns of isolation both by distance (IBD) and
resistance (IBR) across these three ecological scenarios. Plant genetic
diversity appeared unaffected by defaunation-mediated downsizing of
frugivorous lizards. However, we found a reduced overall plant
population connectivity together with an increased isolation by distance
within the most defaunated islands (La Gomera and, to a lesser extent,
Tenerife) when compared with the scenario preserving the functionality
of lizard-mediated seed dispersal (Gran Canaria). The results, with a
significant effect of lizard downsizing, were robust when controlling
for biotic/abiotic differences among the three islands by means of
isolation by resistance models (IBR).Synthesis. Our results provide
valuable insights into the far-reaching consequences of the
deterioration of mutualisms on plant population dynamics over very large
spatial scales. Conservation of large-bodied frugivores is, thus,
essential because their irreplaceable mutualistic dispersal services
maintain an extensive movement of seeds across the landscape, crucial
for maintaining the genetic cohesiveness of metapopulations and the
adaptive potential of plant species across their entire geographical

However, most studies of shrub expansion have focused on dryland
ecosystems (e.g., savannas, rangelands, grasslands), or in tundra
regions (e.g., arctic, alpine). However, shrubs play a key role in other
systems, such as the understory of temperate forests. In the Appalachian
forests of the eastern United States, rhododendron (Rhododendron
maximum) is the most prevalent species constituent of the understory
evergreen shrub community and can affect forest diversity and structure
by altering light and moisture regimes, and changing soil chemical and
physical properties. We examine the spatial patterns and temporal
dynamics of the evergreen shrub layer within a mid-Appalachian forest
over the period from 1986 to 2011 using Landsat TM data to explore how
shrub expansion is related to landscape position (e.g., elevation,
aspect, and distance-to-stream). We use a combination of remotely sensed
vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, tasseled cap indices) derived from
snow-free, leaf-off Landsat 5 surface reflectance data from 1986 to 2011
paired with a Random Forest classification model to examine shrub
dynamics in the Weimer Run watershed near Canaan Valley, West Virginia,
a first-order, high-altitude watershed. We show extensive increases in
winter greenness we attribute to expansion of the evergreen shrub
community. From 1986 to 2011, there is a 0.14 increase in winter NDVI,
with a 52% relative increase in shrub coverage over 25 yr. Shrub
expansion is most notable at lower elevations, along streams, and on
southerly oriented slopes. We argue that changes in shrub abundance are
due to decreased moisture limitations driven by changing climate. There
is an increased effort to reintroduce native conifers to this region,
but changes in the shrub community jeopardize this effort, as
rhododendron inhibits the growth and dispersal of these conifers (e.g.,
red spruce). Our results show that rhododendron shrubs are expanding
into areas of the forest from which they have previously been
restricted. Use of these remote sensing methods may allow better habitat
suitability mapping, leading to better targeted restoration efforts and

likely to accelerate the process of landscape upheavals, and
consequently biodiversity loss.
The aim of this research is to test the potentials of landscape pattern
composition and configuration in safeguarding indigenous avifauna
against the local impacts of climate change in urban landscapes, with
reference to New Zealand. To build up a platform for landscape pattern
interpretation, the literature was reviewed and semi-structured

information about the most important avifauna in the study area, key
information on their ecological traits and niches, possible impacts of
climate change on their primary habitats, and spatial requirements for
ongoing species survival as the climate continues to change. A spatial
analysis of land cover patterns was undertaken in Wellington, New
Zealand using GIS and FRAGSTATS.
Although there are still opportunities for biodiversity conservation in
the study area, the current land cover patterns are unlikely to
safeguard the selected species against climate change impacts.
Eight implications for avifauna persistence under climate change are
discussed for the first time in relation to a New Zealand context. These
implications can give rise to a higher level of informed decision-making

Understanding this is important for managing genetic diversity of threatened species. This study assessed the spatial genetic structure of the rare riparian Grevillea sp. Cooljarloo (Proteaceae), which is restricted to a 20 km(2) region impacted by mining in the northern sandplains of the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, an international biodiversity hotspot. Within creek lines and floodplains, the distribution is largely continuous. Models of dispersal within riparian systems were assessed by spatial genetic analyses including population level partitioning of genetic variation and individual Bayesian clustering. High levels of genetic variation and weak isolation by distance within creek line and floodplain populations suggest large effective population sizes and strong connectivity, with little evidence for unidirectional gene flow as might be expected from hydrochory. Regional clustering of creek line populations and strong divergence among creek line populations suggest substantially lower levels of gene flow among creek lines than within creek lines. There was however a surprising amount of genetic admixture in floodplain populations, which could be explained by irregular flooding and/or movements by highly mobile nectar-feeding bird pollinators. Our results highlight that for conservation of rare riparian species, avoiding an impact to hydrodynamic processes, such as water tables and flooding dynamics, may be just as critical as avoiding direct impacts on the number of plants.},

We found that EM fungal communities were primarily influenced by contemporary climate, but not significantly by the geographic barrier or spatial distance.

abstract = {Variation in seed availability shapes plant communities, and is strongly
affected by seed predation. In some plant species, temporal variation in
seed production is especially high and synchronized over large areas,
which is called `mast seeding'. One selective advantage of this
phenomenon is predator satiation which posits that masting helps plants
escape seed predation through starvation of predators in lean years, and
satiation in mast years. However, even though seed predation can be
predicted to have a strong spatial component and depend on plant
densities, whether the effectiveness of predator satiation in masting
plants changes according to the Janzen-Connell effect has been barely
investigated. We studied, over an 8-year period, the seed production,
the spatiotemporal patters of weevil seed predation, and the abundance
of adult weevils in a holm oak (Quercus ilex) population that consists
of trees interspersed at patches covering a continuum of conspecific
density. Isolated oaks effectively satiate predators, but this is
trumped by increasing conspecific plant density. Lack of predator
satiation in trees growing in dense patches was caused by
re-distribution of insects among plants that likely attenuated them
against food shortage in lean years, and changed the type of weevil
functional response from type II in isolated trees to type III in trees
growing in dense patches. This study provides the first empirical
evaluation of the notion that masting and predator satiation should be
more important in populations that start to dominate their communities,
and is consistent with the observation that masting is less frequent and
less intense in diverse forests.},

abstract = {Ecologists often determine the relative importance of niche- and
dispersal-based processes via variation partitioning based on species
composition. Functional traits and their proxies of phylogeny are
expected to increase the detection of niche-based processes and reduce
the unexplained variation relative to species identity. We collected
eight adult tree traits and phylogenetic data of 41 species and employed
a phylogenetic fuzzy weighting method to address this issue in a 9-ha
temperate forest dynamics plot. We used redundancy analysis to relate
species, phylogenetic and functional compositions to environmental (soil
resources and topography) and spatial variables. We also performed
multi-scaled analyses on spatial variables by adding environment as the
covariates to determine if functional traits increase the detection of
niche-based processes at broad scales. The functional traits and
intraspecific variation of the wood density among ontogenetic stages
could dramatically increase the detection of niche-based processes and
reduce the unexplained variation relative to species identity.
Phylogenetic and functional compositions were mainly driven by total
soil P and elevation, while species composition was weakly affected by
multiple environmental variables. After controlling for the environment,
a larger amount of the compositional variations in seed mass and maximum
height were explained by finer-scaled spatial variables, indicating that
dispersal processes may be important at fine spatial scales. Our results
suggested that considering functional traits and their intraspecific
variations could improve our understanding of ecological processes and
increase our ability to predict the responses of plants to environmental
change.},

abstract = {1. Management programmes seeking to reduce the density of invasive species must overcome compensatory processes, such as recolonisation by dispersers from non- or partially controlled areas. However, the scale and drivers of dispersal in such contexts are poorly known. 2. We investigated the dispersal patterns of American mink re-invading 20,000 km(2) of their non-native range during a culling programme led by citizen conservationists. Using multinomial models, we estimated the contributions of density dependence, proxies for patch quality and distance from the natal patch on mink settlement. 3. Seventy-seven per cent of mink dispersed and settled in non-natal patches. Dispersal distances were large with settlement probabilities only reduced by half at c. 60 km, and 20% of mink dispersing > 80 km. 4. Females were more attracted to high-quality patches, mostly found at low altitudes. Males favoured patches with intermediate current densities and consistently high quality. 5. Synthesis and applications. We predicted post-culling recolonisation by a non-native mobile carnivore over a large spatial scale by using information on relative densities obtained during management interventions, largely carried out by citizen conservationists. This was possible through continued monitoring of the area designed to feed into the adaptive management process of the control project. High mink mobility dictates management should take place on very large spatial scales to minimise re-invasion from uncontrolled areas. Our research shows both males and females are attracted to patches with previously consistent occupation, which provides a degree of predictability to patterns of recolonisation. Targeting control to patches that are attractive to immigrant mink requires knowledge of current mink density. Creating so-called ecological traps in the face of ongoing immigration from peripheral areas provides a promising tool to effectively control mobile invasive species.},

abstract = {Analysis of patterns in the distribution of taxa can provide important insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. Microbial biogeographic patterns almost always appear to be weaker than those reported for plant and animal taxa. It is as yet unclear why this is the case. Some argue that microbial diversity scales differently over space because microbial taxa are fundamentally different in their abundance, longevity and dispersal abilities. Others have argued that differences in scaling are an artifact of how we assess microbial biogeography, driven, for example, by differences in taxonomic resolution, spatial scale, sampling effort or community activity/dormancy. We tested these alternative explanations by comparing bacterial biogeographic patterns in soil to those of trees found in a forest in Gabon. Altering taxonomic resolution, excluding inactive individuals, or adjusting for differences in spatial scale were insufficient to change the rate of microbial taxonomic turnover. In contrast, we account for the differences in spatial turnover between these groups by equalizing sampling extent. Our results suggest that spatial scaling differences between microbial and plant diversity are likely not due to fundamental differences in biology, and that sampling extent should be taken into account when comparing the biogeographic patterns of microorganisms and larger organisms.},

abstract = {A range of indicators have been proposed for identifying the elevated
risk of critical transitions in ecosystems. Most indicators are based on
the idea that critical slowing down can be inferred from changes in
statistical properties of natural fluctuations and spatial patterns.
However, identifying these signals in nature has remained challenging.
An alternative approach is to infer changes in resilience from
differences in standardized experimental perturbations. However,
system-wide experimental perturbations are rarely feasible. Here we
evaluate the potential to infer the risk of large-scale systemic
transitions from local experimental or natural perturbations. We use
models of spatially explicit landscapes to illustrate how recovery rates
upon small-scale perturbations decrease as an ecosystem approaches a
tipping point for a large-scale collapse. We show that the recovery
trajectory depends on: (1) the resilience of the ecosystem at large
scale, (2) the dispersal rate of organisms, and (3) the scale of the
perturbation. In addition, we show that recovery of natural disturbances
in a heterogeneous environment can potentially function as an indicator
of resilience of a large-scale ecosystem. Our analyses reveal
fundamental differences between large-scale weak and local-scale strong
perturbations, leading to an overview of opportunities and limitations
of the use of local disturbance-recovery experiments.},

abstract = {Aim: We constructed an independent phylogeographical hypothesis (IPH)
for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in Scotland and adjacent northern
England and tested if the distribution of contemporary microsatellite
variation accorded with the IPH.
Location: NW Europe.
Methods: Knowledge of post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) landscape
development and salmon biology were used to define a temporal sequence
of late Quaternary ecological niche models and, combined with the
central-marginal (CM) model of diversity evolution, to formulate an IPH.
Observed microsatellite locus variation for salmon from 102 rivers in
Scotland and northern England was tested for agreement with the IPH.
Results: The IPH postulated (1) initial colonization (c. 17 ka BP) of
multiple isolated deglaciating coastal regions by long-distance
dispersal, predominantly from SW Europe via the Atlantic, (2)
intra-region colonization dominated by local range expansion, (3)
differentiation by founder effects/genetic drift, in line with CM, until
deglaciation complete and regions merged (c. 10 ka BP). IPH regions were
weakly but significantly differentiated, showed broad agreement with
genetically defined regions, and genetic diversity within them
positively correlated with time post-deglaciation, conforming to the CM
model. The greatest differentiation was seen for the most recently
diverged populations, with evidence that accumulating homoplastic
mutations muted older regional phylogeographical signatures.
Main conclusions: Microsatellite differentiation in Scottish Atlantic
salmon is significantly but weakly conditioned by post-LGM deglaciation,
with a mosaic of regional groups and a temporal cascade of within-region
CM effects caused by local range expansion as patches became
deglaciated. Colonization was predominantly or exclusively from the
south-western European LGM refugium. Accumulating homoplastic mutations
have increasingly reduced regional differentiation.},

patterns represents a major scientific question for ecologists and
biogeographers. Hence, numerous methods have been developed to determine
the geography of speciation based on co-occurrence between
sister-species. Most of these methods rely on the correlation between
divergence time and several metrics based on the geographic ranges of
sister-taxa (i.e. overlap, asymmetry). The relationship between
divergence time and these metrics has scarcely been examined in a
spatial context beyond regression curves. Mapping this relationship
across spatial grids, however, may unravel how speciation processes have
shaped current biodiversity patterns through space and time. This can be
particularly relevant for coral reef fishes of the Indo-Pacific since
the origin of the exceptional concentration of biodiversity in the
Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) has been actively debated, with
several alternative hypotheses involving species diversification and
dispersal. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships between three
species-rich families of coral reef fish (Chaetodontidae, Labridae,
Pomacentridae) and calculated co-occurrence metrics between closely
related lineages of those families. We demonstrated that repeated
biogeographic processes can be identified in present-day species
distribution by projecting co-occurrence metrics between related
lineages in a geographical context. Our study also evidence that
sister-species do not co-occur randomly across the Indo-Pacific, but
tend to overlap their range within the IAA. We identified the imprint of
two important biogeographic processes that caused this pattern in 48%
of the sister-taxa considered: speciation events within the IAA and
repeated divergence between the Indian and Pacific Ocean, with
subsequent secondary contact in the IAA.},

grouse had a higher survival probability than juveniles throughout the
year with mean annual survival probabilities of 0.280.01 (SE) and 0.13

harvest (H) was greatest at the beginning of the hunting season (Oct;
Frye Mountain H-Oct=0.14 +/- 0.02; Stud Mill H-Oct=0.07 +/- 0.02), and
was lower later in the season (Nov and Dec; Frye Mountain HNov-Dec=0.07

human activities) showed lower nestedness than undisturbed ones.
Immigration rates did not show strong relations with nestedness but
extinction rates were significantly related (negatively) to nestedness.
In addition, disturbance played an important role in determining
immigration rates and variability in immigration rates. Stream
characteristics, such as habitat-size and habitat-variability gradients,
were not statistically significant predictors of immigration and
extinction rates. Our results demonstrate the influence of local
anthropogenic disturbances on dispersal dynamics of species. A reduction

examined the functional trait composition of non-native plants in 69
native urban grasslands in Melbourne, Australia, against the spatial
attributes of remnant patches and the surrounding road network at
multiple spatial scales. We predicted that (1) urbanisation favours
non-native plants with evolved characteristics conferring resistance to
urban environments, (2) high road density in the immediate vicinity of
remnants drives high non-native functional diversity, and (3) non-native

was positively associated with road density across the urban landscape,
and community-weighted Specific Leaf Area was negatively associated with
road density. At local scales, non-native plant functional diversity was
positively associated with road density in the immediate vicinity of
grasslands. Urbanisation favoured non-native plants invested in
persistence over resource acquisition, potentially in response to the
urban climate and declines in fire frequency. Re-introducing historic
fire regimes may therefore have the potential to be a key strategy in
reducing competition from non-native plants. High non-native functional

abstract = {A good knowledge about species traits variability in relation to their
environment is the cornerstone of landscape-oriented species management
studies. One way to infer this relationship is to compare species
signatures in space and time from field data with spatially explicit
population dynamics models outputs. However, the inference robustness
relies on the available field data, and thus on the quality of the
underlying sampling strategy. Field sampling is constrained by several
factors, such as the number of landscape replicates, possible number of
temporal sessions and number of sample locations, that need to be
accounted for prior to field sampling. We set and illustrate a heuristic
method to answer the question of optimal sampling conditioned by these
landscape-induced constraints. First we studied a real agricultural
landscape to determine its mean properties in terms of configuration and
composition. The real landscape properties were used as constraints in a
landscape model to generate a collection of landscapes with similar
properties. On the other hand, we formulated population dynamics models
(hereafter noted Process Models (PM)) carrying competing hypotheses
about two ecological processes-population growth and dispersal-in
relation to spatial covariates for Pterostichus melanarius, a carabid
species involved in pest regulation. We simulated these spatially
explicit models and extracted their sampling-dependent signatures, i.e.
metrics computed on different population samples. We defined a sampling
design quality as its ability to capture the contrasts between the PM
signatures, summarised by the performance of a classification procedure.
The most relevant sampling design was selected on the basis of
classification performance and in situ feasibility. Finally we explored
the effects of the a priori ecological hypotheses quality on
classification performances, through a sensitivity analysis of the PM
parameters. While some improvements remain to be achieved before being
fully operational for landscape ecologists, our framework contributes to
bringing closer sampling theory and its application on the field. It
endorses the use of landscape modelling to design sampling prior to
field experiment to bring out the best from sampled data.},

limitation rather than temperature and soil moisture restricted the
recruitment of pines at the upper elevational range.Synthesis. Our study
highlights the importance of biotic interactions and dispersal ability

abstract = {Aim: Ongoing climate change is currently modifying the geographical
location of areas that are climatically suitable for species.
Understanding a species' ability to successfully shift its geographical
range would allow us to assess extinction risks and predict future
community compositions. We investigate how habitat configuration impedes
or promotes climate-driven range shifts, given different speeds of
climate change and dispersal abilities.
Location: Theoretical, but illustrated with European examples.
Methods: We model how a species' ability to track a directional shift in
climatic conditions is affected by (a) species' dispersal abilities; (b)
speed of climatic shift; and (c) spatial arrangement of the habitat. Our
modelling framework includes within-and between-patch population
dynamics and uses ecologically realistic habitat distributions and
dispersal scenarios (verified with data from a set of European mammal
species) and, as such, is an improvement of classical range shift
models.
Result: In landscapes with a homogeneous distribution of suitable
habitats, all but the least dispersive species will be able to range
shift. However, species with high dispersal ability will have lower
population densities after range shift. In heterogeneous landscapes
species' ability to range shift is far more variable and heavily
dependent on the habitat configuration. This means that landscape
configuration in combination with the speed of climate change and
species dispersal abilities give rise to nonlinear effects on population
sizes and survival after a climatic shift.
Main conclusions: Our analyses point out the importance of accounting
for the interplay of species dispersal and the landscape configuration
when estimating future climate impact on species. These results link
ecologically important attributes of both species and their landscapes
to outcomes of species range shift, and thereby long-term persistence of
ecological communities.},

abstract = {Climate change can increase spatial synchrony of population dynamics,
leading to large-scale fluctuation that destabilizes communities. High
trophic level species such as parasitoids are disproportionally affected
because they depend on unstable resources. Most parasitoid wasps have
complementary sex determination, producing sterile males when inbred,
which can theoretically lead to population extinction via the diploid
male vortex (DMV). We examined this process empirically using a
hyperparasitoid population inhabiting a spatially structured host
population in a large fragmented landscape. Over four years of high host
butterfly metapopulation fluctuation, diploid male production by the
wasp increased, and effective population size declined precipitously.
Our multitrophic spatially structured model shows that host population
fluctuation can cause local extinctions of the hyperparasitoid because
of the DMV. However, regionally it persists because spatial structure
allows for efficient local genetic rescue via balancing selection for
rare alleles carried by immigrants. This is, to our knowledge, the first
empirically based study of the possibility of the DMV in a natural
host-parasitoid system.},

connectivity is a pervasive effect of humans on animal populations. In
many terrestrial and aquatic systems, there is increasing tension
between the need to simultaneously allow passage of some species while
blocking the passage of other species. We explore the ecological basis
for selective fragmentation of riverine systems where the need to
restrict movements of invasive species conflicts with the need to allow
passage of species of commercial, recreational, or conservation concern.
We develop a trait-based framework for selective fish passage based on
understanding the types of movements displayed by fishes and the role of
ecological filters in determining the spatial distributions of fishes.
We then synthesize information on trait-based mechanisms involved with
these filters to create a multidimensional niche space based on
attributes such as physical capabilities, body morphology, sensory
capabilities, behavior, and movement phenology. Following this, we
review how these mechanisms have been applied to achieve selective fish
passage across anthropogenic barriers. To date, trap-and-sort or
capture-translocation efforts provide the best options for movement
filters that are completely species selective, but these methods are
hampered by the continual, high cost of manual sorting. Other less
effective methods of selective passage risk collateral damage in the
form of lower or higher than desired levels of passage. Fruitful areas
for future work include using combinations of ecological and behavioral
traits to passively segregate species; using taxon-specific chemical or
auditory cues to direct unwanted species away from passageways and into
physical or ecological traps while attracting desirable species to
passageways; and developing automated sorting mechanisms based on fish
recognition systems. The trait-based approach proposed for fish could
serve as a template for selective fragmentation in other ecological
systems.},

differentiation due to the potential for long-distance dispersal

advection of water masses or retentive hydrodynamic forces can influence
the degree of genetic exchange among marine populations. To determine
the oceanographic drivers of genetic structure in a highly dispersive
marine invertebrate, the giant California sea cucumber (Parastichopus
californicus), we first tested for the presence of genetic
discontinuities along the coast of North America in the northeastern
Pacific Ocean. Then, we tested two hypotheses regarding spatial
processes influencing population structure: (i) isolation by distance
(IBD: genetic structure is explained by geographic distance) and (ii)
isolation by resistance (IBR: genetic structure is driven by ocean
circulation). Using RADseq, we genotyped 717 individuals from 24
sampling locations across 2,719 neutral SNPs to assess the degree of
population differentiation and integrated estimates of genetic variation
with inferred connectivity probabilities from a biophysical model of
larval dispersal mediated by ocean currents. We identified two clusters
separating north and south regions, as well as significant, albeit weak,
substructure within regions (F-ST = 0.002, p = .001). After modelling
the asymmetric nature of ocean currents, we demonstrated that local
oceanography (IBR) was a better predictor of genetic variation (R-2 =
.49) than geographic distance (IBD) (R-2 = .18), and directional
processes played an important role in shaping fine-scale structure. Our
study contributes to the growing body of literature identifying
significant population structure in marine systems and has important
implications for the spatial management of P.californicus and other

major conflicts with birds, including birds of prey. Hence, it is
desirable that the space use of species known to be vulnerable to wind
energy be assessed in light of current and future developments. Here, we
report on the large-scale dispersal movements of pre-breeding
white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Finland, where a currently
modest wind-energy capacity is expected to increase in the near future.
We studied white-tailed eagle space use with a particular focus on the
potential for annual power production (GWh) at specific locations, as
estimated by the Finnish Wind Atlas. Also, we aimed to detect a
potential human-wildlife conflict by assessing white-tailed eagle space
use against the spatial distribution of existing and recently proposed
wind farms. We found that, despite visiting a large proportion of the
country, the eagles stayed primarily within coastal areas and islands,
restricted to where human infrastructure was present only at very small
amounts. Because of the distribution of wind resources, such areas were
found to contain considerable potential for power production. The eagles
visited most of the areas targeted for wind-energy development. However,
these areas did not coincide with a higher-than-average eagle relocation
frequency, suggesting that the existing and recently proposed wind farms
do not represent an elevated threat to dispersing eagles. Caution should
nevertheless be taken against interpreting that co-occurrence poses no
threat at any given site, as site selection is paramount to avoid
conflicts with avian conservation.},

whether community assembly processes differ for plants with different
phenologies. In this study, we ask whether early- and late-blooming
species differ in the ways that dispersal, persistence and resource
acquisition traits shape plant occurrence patterns in patchy habitats.
We sampled plant communities in 51 Ozark dolomite glade grasslands,
which range in size from <1ha to >100ha. We modelled the occurrence of
71 spring- and 43 summer-blooming grassland species in these patches,
using as predictors both environmental variables (landscape structure,
soil resources) and plant traits related to dispersal, longevity and
resource acquisition. We were especially interested in how the
environmental variables and plant traits interacted to determine the
occurrence of phenological strategies in habitats that vary in size and
isolation. Summer-blooming species with better persistence and dispersal
abilities had higher relative frequencies in smaller, more isolated
habitat patches, and summer-blooming species with higher specific leaf
areasuggesting fast growth and low stress tolerancewere more likely to
occur in patches with greater soil organic matter and clay content.
However, spring-blooming species showed much weaker interactions between
functional traits and environmental gradients, perhaps because
environmental conditions are less harsh in spring than in
summer.Synthesis. Several axes of plant life-history variation may
simultaneously influence community responses to habitat connectivity. In
this case, explicitly considering plant phenology helped identify
generalizable relationships between functional traits and landscape
spatial structure.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the drivers and spatial scale of gene flow is essential
for the management of species living in fragmented landscapes. In
plants, contemporary pollen flow is typically modelled as a single
spatial process, with pollen flow declining exponentially within a short
distance of mother plants. However, growing evidence suggests that many
species do not conform to these patterns, often showing an excess of
long-distance dispersal events or sometimes even multimodality in
dispersal kernels. This suggests that a single function might be
insufficient to capture the true complexity of pollination, which in
reality is often achieved by multiple pollinators that vary in their
foraging ranges and interactions with the landscape.
2. We reconstructed realized pollen flow and assessed pollen immigration
for seven populations of the insect-pollinated herb Pulsatilla vulgaris.
We quantified the effects of distance, floral resources and landscape
composition over multiple spatial scales and tested the hypotheses that
within-population pollen flow is related to resources and landscape
context measured locally, and that among-population pollen flow is
related to features measured at larger spatial scales.
3. We found that pollen flow within populations was more likely to occur
amongst near neighbours, but that among-population pollen flow was
random with respect to source populations. We further found that local
floral density could explain patterns of within-population pollination
distances and population-level selfing rates, whereas pollen immigration
rates were best explained by the proportion of forest within a radius of
500 m around focal populations.
4. Synthesis. Together, our results suggest that within- and
among-population contemporary pollen flow may be governed by different
underlying processes, possibly related to differences in the foraging
range and habitat use of bee species that contribute to pollination at
different scales. This highlights the critical need for researchers to
take a more pollinator-eyed view of contemporary pollen flow in plants
by (1) recognizing that within- and among-population gene flow by pollen
may depend on different sets of pollinators that respond to features at
different spatial scales (2) considering additional factors that may
alter attractiveness, detectability and accessibility of plants to
pollinators beyond the effects of distance.},

Little is known, however, on insect community responses to different

To determine temporal changes in beetle responses to different
farmland-woodland edges, and document cross-habitat movement.
We examined species richness, abundance, and movement across edges
between remnant woodlands and four farmland uses (plantings, fallow,
annual crops, woody debris applied over crops post-harvest) in
southeastern Australia. We used directional pitfall traps to infer
movement, and sampled at edges, and 20 and 200 m on both sides of edges,
during spring and summer.
Detritivore and predator abundance varied between seasons across the
edge between woodlands and all farmlands, but seasonal differences were
weaker for fallow-woodland and woody debris-woodland edges. Detritivores
moved from farmlands towards woodlands, but not across fallow-woodlands
and woody debris-woodlands edges during summer. During summer, predators
showed short-range movement towards edges from all farmlands except
plantings, and towards woody debris from woodlands. Edges showed
temporally stable predator richness and higher herbivore richness than
adjoining habitats.
Farmland use and season interactively affect beetle abundance across
farmland-woodland edges. Woody debris can reduce seasonal fluctuations
in beetle edge responses and increase permeability for cross-habitat
movement, while plantings provide habitat during summer. Edges provide
important resources for beetles in adjoining habitats, however, seasonal
movement of predators specifically into edges may affect prey
assemblages-a link requiring further study.},

Dispersal, when viewed as a component of phenotype, can be affected independently or jointly by environment. However, among taxa with complex life cycles that occupy different habitats over ontogeny, the effects of environment on dispersal and the interaction between environment and phenotype remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted a field experiment to measure how dispersal distance was affected by phenotype, environment experienced before and after metamorphosis, and their interaction. We manipulated the environment encountered by a pond-breeding salamander Ambystoma annulatum during the aquatic larval stage and again as dispersing terrestrial juveniles. After assaying juvenile phenotype (exploration behavior, body condition, and morphology), we then measured the initial distance dispersed by juveniles. The distance moved by dispersing salamanders was affected by attributes of both larval and juvenile habitat, with salamanders that encountered low quality habitat in either life stage moving the farthest. However, we did not find support for an interactive effect of phenotype and environment affecting the distance moved by dispersers. Interestingly, exploration behavior explained the distance moved by philopatric animals but not dispersing ones. Our findings indicate that the environment experienced before metamorphosis can affect juvenile dispersal behavior, and demonstrates the need to consider dispersal in species with complex life cycles to understand the coupling between local and regional population dynamics.},

Complex arrangements of geographical barriers (hydrology and topography)

Here, we explicitly test alternative diversification modes in the

barriers, environmental stability and demographic history. We reveal
highly congruent intra-specific diversity and population structure

forest refugia, dispersal barriers and demographic models point towards
idiosyncratic diversification modes across taxa. We identify a
consistent role for riverine barriers in the diversification of
generalist taxa, but mechanisms of diversification are more complex for
forest taxa and potentially include topographical barriers, forest

latitudinal) variation in fruit colour, colour diversity and length, and

Location Time period Global. Present day. Major taxa studied Methods
Seed plants. We assembled a database of fruit traits for 13,178 fleshy
fruited plant species spanning 136 sites around the world. To assess
whether fruit colour categories correspond with spectral reflectances,
we tested for clustering of hue, chroma and saturation for 236 species
for which we had reflectance data. We then quantified latitudinal
gradients in fruit colour, fruit length and fruit colour diversity while
controlling for the effects of plant habit and whether colour categories
varied with respect to average fruit size. Results Main conclusions
Colour categories corresponded well with reflectance data. The tropics
show high colour diversity, while red fruits progressively constitute a
higher proportion of the fleshy-fruited plant community towards high
latitudes. All mammal-associated colours (green, orange, brown and
yellow) are more common in the tropics than at high latitudes. Fruit
length also increases towards the tropics. Tropical communities tend to
have diverse fruit colours, including many mammal-associated fruit
colours, while high latitude communities contain a higher percentage of
red-fruited species. The correlation between colour and size is strong,
and some latitudinal patterns may be partly driven by changes in fruit
size. Differences in geography and in the history of plant lineages in
the Southern versus the Northern Hemisphere may help to explain some
biogeographic patterns, but alternative hypotheses related to fruit
defence, development and metabolic costs are plausible.},

much research has studied this relationship. But the potential effect of
landscape configuration on biodiversity's response to intensification

simplifications of the sparing/sharing dichotomy. In particular, we
study species richness decline in landscapes encompassing a combined

richness along an intensification gradient shifts from following a
robust response to presenting an abrupt decline, as landscape

abstract = {Limited seed or pollen dispersal enhances spatial genetic relatedness between individuals (fine-scale spatial genetic structure, FSGS), which usually decreases as a function of physical distance. However, such isotropic pattern of FSGS may not always occur when spatially asymmetric processes, for instance, wind direction during dispersal, are considered in wind-pollinated and -dispersed plants. This study assessed the pattern of FSGS in the keystone tropical wetland plant Cyperus papyrus (papyrus) as a function of these isotropic and anisotropic processes. We tested the hypothesis that the FSGS would be influenced by predominant wind direction during pollen and seed dispersal, as well as by the physical distance between individuals. We genotyped a total of 510 adults and 407 juveniles from three papyrus swamps (Ethiopia) using 15 microsatellite markers. In addition, the contemporary directional dispersal by wind was evaluated by seed release-recapture experiments and complemented with parentage analysis. Adults and juveniles differed in the strength of isotropic FSGS ranging from 0.09 to 0.13 and 0.12 to 0.16, respectively, and this suggests variation in dispersal distance. Anisotropic FSGS was found to be a function of asymmetric wind direction during dispersal/pollination that varied between sites. Historical gene dispersal distance was astoundingly low (<4 m), possibly due to localized seed rain. According to our contemporary dispersal estimates, mean pollen dispersal distances were longer than those of seed dispersal (101 and <55 m, respectively). More than two-thirds of seeds and half of pollen grains were locally dispersed (<= 80 m). The difference in historical and contemporary dispersal distance probably resulted from the asymmetric wind direction due to change in vegetation cover in the surrounding matrix.

abstract = {Poaching is a major threat to large predator populations, but the
predictors of poaching are poorly mapped in developed countries where
illegal killing is motivated by social reasons. Poaching can be common
although the species is legally hunted, such as in the case of the wolf
(Canis lupus). Our goal was to identify crucial motives of poaching to
find possible solutions to the ongoing wolf conflict. We studied
predictors of poaching on two spatial scales - countrywide (76 wolves)
and territory {[}30 Global Positioning System (GPS)-wolves] - during
2001-2016 in Finland. The countrywide factors predicting illegal kill
were as follows: (1) lifestage, with adult wolves showing a remarkably
high probability of being illegally killed in comparison with juveniles;
(2) the number of wolves killed legally in the local scale, that is,
licensed wolf hunting at the local scale decreased the likelihood of
illegal killing, as did the total number of legally hunted wolves; (3)
total legal bag in the whole country; and (4) density of the local human
population, that is, low human density increased the probability of
illegal kill. For breeding adult GPS-collared wolves at the territory
level, there was a positive relationship between the tendency to cross
roads and likelihood of being illegally killed. Our results provided
evidence that poaching is a matter of local intolerance toward wolves
and that the problem is mainly related to wolf hunting. Legal hunting
might decrease poaching, but seems inefficient as a long-term solution.
To maintain a viable wolf population, the poaching risk of breeding
adults should be decreased. Predicted poaching probabilities could be
used to tackle poaching in a preventive manner by involving both
decision makers and local residents in anti-poaching actions.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause geographic shifts in tree species'
ranges, but such shifts may not keep pace with climate changes because
seed dispersal distances are often limited and competition-induced
changes in community composition can be relatively slow. Disturbances
may speed changes in community composition, but the interactions among
climate change, disturbance and competitive interactions to produce
range shifts are poorly understood. We used a physiologically based
mechanistic landscape model to study these interactions in the
northeastern United States. We designed a series of disturbance
scenarios to represent varied disturbance regimes in terms of both
disturbance extent and intensity. We simulated forest succession by
incorporating climate change under a high-emissions future,
disturbances, seed dispersal, and competition using the landscape model
parameterized with forest inventory data. Tree species range boundary
shifts in the next century were quantified as the change in the location
of the 5th (the trailing edge) and 95th (the leading edge) percentiles
of the spatial distribution of simulated species. Simulated tree species
range boundary shifts in New England over the next century were far
below (usually < 20 km) that required to track the velocity of
temperature change (usually more than 110 km over 100 years) under a
high-emissions scenario. Simulated species` ranges shifted northward at
both the leading edge (northern boundary) and trailing edge (southern
boundary). Disturbances may expedite species' recruitment into new
sites, but they had little effect on the velocity of simulated range
boundary shifts. Range shifts at the trailing edge tended to be
associated with photosynthetic capacity, competitive ability for light
and seed dispersal ability, whereas shifts at the leading edge were
associated only with photosynthetic capacity and competition for light.
This study underscores the importance of understanding the role of
interspecific competition and disturbance when studying tree range
shifts.},

abstract = {Understanding large-scale spatial variation in ecosystem properties and
associated functionality is key for successful conservation of
ecosystems. This study provides a template for how to estimate
differences in ecosystem functionality over large spatial scales by
using groupings of biological traits. We focus on trait groupings that
describe three important benthic ecosystem properties, namely
bioturbation, community stability, and juvenile dispersal. Recognizing
that groups of traits interact and are constrained within an organism,
we statistically define important functional trait subgroups that
describe each ecosystem property. The sub-groups are scored according to
their weighted ecological impact to gain an overall estimation of the
cumulative expression of each ecosystem property at individual sites.
Furthermore, by assigning each property a value relative to its observed
maximum, and by summing up the individual property values, we offer an
estimate of benthic ecosystem multi-functionality. Based on a spatially
extensive benthic data set, we were able to identify coastal areas with
high and low potential for the considered benthic ecosystem properties
and the measure of ecosystem multifunctionality. Importantly, we show
that a large part of the spatial variation in functional trait
sub-groups and in benthic ecosystem multifunctionality was explained by
environmental change. Our results indicate that through this
simplification it is possible to estimate the functionality of the
seafloor. Such information is vital in marine spatial planning efforts

conservation biologists. Here, we characterized the pattern of neutral
genetic diversity and we inferred underlying processes in the
habitat-forming octocoral Paramuricea clavata in the Adriatic Sea, a
peculiar phylogeographic region of the Mediterranean Sea. Location
Methods Eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea. We genotyped seven
microsatellites in 454 individuals of P. clavata from 13 populations
recolonized after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We estimated the
levels of contemporary connectivity and genetic drift and we
reconstructed the demographic history of these populations. Results Main
conclusion The pattern of spatial genetic structure resulted from the
combination of hierarchical genetic clusters and isolation by distance
(IBD). A significant decrease in genetic diversity and an increase of
the frequencies of individual alleles likely due to allele surfing from
the south to the north of the area were observed as expected after a
postglacial sequential recolonization. Based on maximum likelihood
analyses, the foundation of these populations was not linked to dramatic
change in population size. Oceanographic barriers to gene flow combined
to the restricted dispersal of P. clavata likely maintain the
hierarchical structure and the IBD pattern. We suggest that the
latitudinal genetic gradient results from a northward ``serial founder
events{''} recolonization. By integrating patterns and processes, we
bridge the gap between the evolutionary and the conservation biology of
P. clavata, providing management guidelines, which will benefit the
associated coralligenous biodiversity.},

abstract = {Gene conservation programs help safeguard species and tangibly benefit
ecological restoration, agriculture, forestry, and horticulture. Here we
describe a new method for deciding which and how many populations and
individuals to conserve ex situ, and we demonstrate the method by
evaluating collections of European Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) for an
ongoing seed-banking project, the UK National Tree Seed Project (NTSP).
The method uses simulations and geographic distribution data, and does
not require (but can utilize) genetic data. We estimate that NTSP
collections have captured > 90% of all alleles and of locally common
alleles. We identified optimal sampling solutions at large and small
spatial scales, and for northern isolated vs. southern core populations.
We also quantified genetic ``points of diminishing returns{''} with a
more precise method than previous studies. This analysis revealed that
(for European ash, for a goal of capturing one copy of each allele) an
optimal ``stopping point{''} is approximately 35 populations, 10 to 30
trees per population, and 30 seeds per tree. Overall, we conclude that
the NTSP protocol of random sampling of at least 15 trees per population
from two populations per seed zone is effective. We demonstrated how
collectors can adjust the number of populations, individuals and seeds
sampled using the concept of ``genetic equivalence{''}, allowing
projects to accommodate practical or ecological constraints. Lastly we
showed that for a conservation goal of 50 allele copies rather than one
copy, a much larger sampling effort is needed ( > 150 populations). This
new approach can be tailored to any species. It is applicable to any
seed collection seeking to capture genetic diversity, as well as in situ
gene conservation approaches. We emphasize that the ability to
quantitatively estimate the outcome of gene conservation activities can
help design, justify, or evaluate future programs.},

strong selection associated with spatial environmental heterogeneity is
expected to drive localized adaptive divergence, even in the face of
connectivity. We tested this hypothesis using a seascape genomics
approach in the commercially important greenlip abalone (Haliotis
laevigata). We assessed how its population structure has been influenced
by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in
southern Australia linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our data
sets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and
environmental mapping across similar to 800 km. Genotype-environment
association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral
and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species
is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation
(global F-ST = 0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a
stepping-stone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however,
model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent
population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the
distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to
selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen
concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with
functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance,
including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found
in other biogeographic regions. Our study includes a documented example
about the uptake of genomic information in fisheries management and
supports the hypothesis of adaptive divergence due to coastal

variables for species distribution modelling on rare species, with
seahorses as an example, deriving ecological knowledge and spatially
explicit maps to advance global seahorse conservation.
Location: The shallow seas.
Methods: We applied a typical species distribution model (SDM), maximum
entropy, to examine the utility of (1) two versions of habitat variables
(habitat occurrences vs. proximity to habitats) and (2) three sources of
species data: quality research-grade (RG) data, quality-unknown citizen
science (CS) and museum-collection (MC) data. We used the best
combinations of species data and habitat variables to predict
distributions and estimate species-habitat relations and threatened
status for seahorse species.
Results: We demonstrated that using proximity to habitats and
integrating all species datasets (RG, CS and MC) derived models with the
highest accuracies among all dataset variations. Based on this finding,
we derived reliable models for 33 species. Our models suggested that
only 0.4% of potential seahorse range was suitable to more than three
species together; seahorse biogeographic epicentres were mainly in the
Philippines; and proximity to sponges was an important habitat variable.
We found that 12 Data Deficient species might be threatened based on our
predictions according to IUCN criteria.
Main conclusions: We highlight that using proper habitat variables
(e.g., proximity to habitats) is critical to determine distributions and
key habitats for low-mobility animals; collating and integrating
quality-unknown occurrences (e.g., CS and MC) with quality research data
are meaningful for building SDMs for rare species. We encourage the
application of SDMs to estimate area of occupancy for rare organisms to
facilitate their conservation status assessment.},

diversification among colourful and flightless weevils, the
Pachyrhynchus orbifer complex, to test the stepping-stone hypothesis of
colonization across the Taiwan-Luzon volcanic belt.
Location: Southeast Asia.
Methods: The phylogeny of the P. orbifer complex was reconstructed from
a multi-locus data set of mitochondrial and nuclear genes using maximum
likelihood in RAxML and Bayesian inference in MRBAYES. Likelihood-based
tests in CONSEL were used to evaluate alternative tree topologies.
Divergence times were estimated in beast based on a range of mutation
rates. Ancestral range and biogeographical history were reconstructed
using Bayesian binary MCMC (BBM) methods in RASP and in BioGeoBEARS.
Demographic histories were inferred using the extended Bayesian skyline
plot (EBSP). Species boundaries were tested using BPP.
Results: The phylogeny of the P. orbifer complex indicated strong
support for seven reciprocally monophyletic lineages grouped by current
island boundaries (Camiguin, Fuga, Dalupiri, Calayan, Babuyan, Orchid
and Yaeyama Islands), except for a sister Green + Itbayat lineage.
Complex and stochastic colonization of P. orbifer was inferred to have
involved both northward and southward directions with short- and
long-distance dispersal events, which are strongly inconsistent with the
strict stepping-stone hypothesis. Divergence time estimates for all
extant island lineages (<1 Myr of Middle Pleistocene) are much more
recent than the geological ages (22.4-1.7 Myr) and subaerial existence
(c. 3 Myr) of the islands. The statistically delimited seven cryptic
species imply that the diversity of Pachyrhynchus from small peripheral
islands continues to be largely under-estimated.
Main conclusions: The non-linear, more complex spatial and temporal
settings of the archipelago and stochastic dispersal were probable key
factors shaping the colonization history of the P. orbifer complex.
Speciation of the P. orbifer complex may have occurred only between
islands, indicating that peripatric speciation through the founders of
stochastic dispersals was the major evolutionary driver.},

LocationBrazil, except Amazonian region.
MethodsWe compiled 31 local binary plant-hummingbird networks, combining
them into one cross-biomes metanetwork. We conducted a modularity
analysis and tested the relationship between species' module membership
with traits, geographical location, climatic conditions and range sizes,
employing random forest models. We fitted reduced models containing
groups of related variables (climatic, spatial, phylogenetic, traits)
and combinations of groups to partition the variance explained by these
sets into unique and shared components.
ResultsThe Brazilian cross-biomes network was composed of 479 plant and
42 hummingbird species, and showed significant modularity. The resulting
six modules conformed well to vegetation domains. Only plant traits, not
hummingbird traits, differed between modules, notably plants' growth
form, corolla length, flower shape and colour. Some modules included
plant species with very restricted distributions, whereas others
encompassed more widespread ones. Widespread hummingbirds were the most
connected, both within and between modules, whereas widespread plants
were the most connected between modules. Among traits, only nectar
concentration had a weak effect on among-module connectivity.
Main conclusionsClimate and spatial filters were the main determinants
of module composition for hummingbirds and plants, potentially related
to resource seasonality, especially for hummingbirds. Historical
dispersal-linked contingency, or environmental variations not accounted
for by the explanatory factors here evaluated, could also contribute to
the spatial component. Phylogeny and morphological traits had no unique
effects on the assignment of species to modules. Widespread species
showed higher within- and/or among-module connectivity, indicating their
key role connecting biomes, and, in the case of hummingbirds,
communities within biomes. Our results indicate that biogeography and
climate not only determine the variation of modularity in local
plant-animal networks, as previously shown, but also affect the
cross-biomes network structure.},

hierarchies, is one mechanism that can promote the local coexistence of
competitors and maintain high local species diversity, although its
prevalence and importance remain largely unknown. A full understanding
of local community assembly needs knowledge of how transitive and
intransitive competitive interactions are linked to species functional
traits and the strength of biotic and abiotic filters. We apply a
recently developed statistical tool to quantitative data on central
European inland saltmarsh plant communities to infer causal
relationships between soil characteristics, species occurrences and
functional traits, and we estimated coefficients of competition. We
found a predominance of intransitive competitive hierarchies. The
proportion of such hierarchies was positively correlated with local
species richness and compositional variability. Average soil
characteristics were not correlated with competitive intransitivity,
whereas high soil pH and the high variability in local pH and soil
salinity decreased the overall impact of competition on community
composition. In pairwise comparisons of species, dissimilarity in
morphology, resource demand and reproductive phenology was significantly
negatively correlated with differences in competitive performance, while
higher environmental dissimilarity was particularly linked to
intermediate degrees of competitive superiority. Our results suggest
that habitat filtering for similar traits might intensify competitive
interactions, but might also give rise to intransitive competitive loops
that subsequently promote species coexistence and permit species'
functional equivalence. Intransitive competition appears to increase
local diversity and small scale-species turnover. The observed local
differences in competitive structures suggest frequent competitive
plasticity and context-dependent competitive interactions. Finally, our
results support the view that local abundance distributions can be used
to infer the strength and outcome of competitive interactions.Synthesis.
Our results confirm that intransitive competitive interactions might be
a strong force structuring local plant communities. Intransitivity needs
to be considered when studying plant community assembly and species

matched the pattern of gated versus wicket style dams. Simulations using

in La Grange Pool while Silver Carp accumulate in Alton Pool. Fewer
Bighead Carp reached the upper river compared to Silver Carp during
simulations. Reducing upstream movement probabilities (e.g., reduced

We studied how spatio-temporal variation in the risk-resource trade-off,
generated by fluctuations in human activities and environmental
conditions, influences the routine movements of roe deer across a
heterogeneous landscape, generating shifts in functional connectivity at
daily and seasonal time scales.
We used GPS locations of 172 adult roe deer and step selection functions
to infer landscape connectivity. In particular, we assessed the
influence of six habitat features on fine scale movements across four
biological seasons and three daily periods, based on variations in the
risk-resource trade-off.
The influence of habitat features on roe deer movements was strongly
dependent on proximity to refuge habitat, i.e. woodlands. Roe deer
confined their movements to safe habitats during daytime and during the
hunting season, when human activity is high. However, they exploited
exposed open habitats more freely during night-time. Consequently, we
observed marked temporal shifts in landscape connectivity, which was
highest at night in summer and lowest during daytime in autumn. In
particular, the onset of the autumn hunting season induced an abrupt
decrease in landscape connectivity.
Human disturbance had a strong impact on roe deer movements, generating
pronounced spatio-temporal variation in landscape connectivity. However,
high connectivity at night across all seasons implies that Europe's most
abundant and widespread large herbivore potentially plays a key role in
transporting ticks, seeds and nutrients among habitats.},

MethodsPollen count data from 16 sites were transformed to estimates of
distance-weighted vegetation abundance using the LRA (REVEALS and LOVE
models), correcting for bias in pollen production and dispersal.
Charcoal concentration data from six sites were normalized using Box-Cox
transformation to produce z-scores. Moving-window correlation was
undertaken to compare pollen percentage values for key taxa (Calluna,
Poaceae) and localized burning. Estimates of distance-vegetation
abundance (LRA output) and time-averaged charcoal z-scores were compared
to assess the role of burning as a driver for upland vegetation cover.
ResultsComparison of pollen percentage and normalized charcoal z-scores
show little correlation between vegetation cover and burning. Estimates
of distance-weighted vegetation abundance and normalized charcoal data
show relationships between vegetation change and burning at four of the
six sites. The relationships are site-specific: three sites suggest
burning promoted grass-dominated vegetation, at one site burning
promoted heather-dominated vegetation, and in two sites there is no
apparent relationship.
ConclusionsThe patterning of vegetation within uplands is a crucial part
of ecosystem service delivery, and contemporary and future management
benefits from understanding of long-term' development, i.e. patterns
over millennia. The correction of biases within pollen production and
dispersal to produce local vegetation estimates has demonstrated spatial
heterogeneity in vegetation cover on Exmoor that is not otherwise
evident in the pollen percentage data (which retain a strong influence
of the regional vegetation cover). The relationship between LRA-derived
vegetation cover and burning is not apparent in comparisons between
pollen percentage data and charcoal records. This implies that studies
that use pollen proportional data alone can misrepresent the
relationship between vegetation cover and fire. This study demonstrates
that fire has been an important part of the development of this cultural
landscape.},

simulations to evaluate the impact of increasing levels of matrix
generalization on connectivity assessment using a constant arrangement
of habitat patches. We varied matrix generalization for six simulated
landscape patterns by adjusting the number of classes and level of
pattern grain in 16 ways to yield sets of landscapes for which the
matrix ranged from not generalized (i.e., heterogeneous) to completely
generalized (i.e., homogeneous) while habitat placement was held
constant. Least-cost paths were calculated for each landscape, and a
spatial interaction model (SIM) was implemented to model the counts of
patch inflows (immigration) and pairwise exchange. Applying a SIM
allowed us to generate absolute outputs and explicitly compare the
effect of changes to matrix generalization on connectivity. We found
that both assessment of connections (i.e., measured distance and spatial
delineation of least-cost paths) and patch inflows/pairwise exchange
were highly sensitive to matrix generalization and that effects were
inconsistent and unpredictable across the range of matrix
representations, especially when estimating connectivity for individual
patches. We conclude that matrix pattern may have an underappreciated
effect on connectivity and that least-cost path delineation and
connectivity assessment may be very sensitive to generalizations of the
matrix. We suggest that sensitivity analysis of the matrix
representation should be performed when conducting connectivity
analyses.},

abstract = {Background: A utilization distribution quantifies the temporal and
spatial probability of space use for individuals or populations. These
patterns in movement arise from individuals' internal state and from
their response to the external environment, and thus can provide
insights for assessing factors associated with the management of
threatened populations. The Western Distinct Population Segment of the
Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) has declined to approximately 20%
of levels encountered 40 years ago. At the height of the decline,
juvenile survival appeared to be depressed and currently there is
evidence that juvenile mortality due to predation may be constraining
recovery in some regions. Therefore, our objectives were to identify
what spaces are biologically important to juvenile Steller sea lions in
the Kenai Fjords and Prince William Sound regions of the Gulf of Alaska.
Methods: We examined geospatial location data from juvenile sea lions
tagged between 2000 and 2014 (n = 84) and derived individual and
pooled-population utilization distributions (UDs) from their movements.
Core areas were defined from the UDs using an individual-based approach;
this quantitatively confirmed that all individuals in our sample
exhibited concentrated use within their home range (95% UD). Finally,
we explored if variation in UD characteristics were associated with sex,
season, age, or region.
Results: We found evidence that individual juvenile home ranges were
region and sex-specific, with males having larger home ranges on
average. Core space characteristics were also sex-specific, and
exhibited seasonal patterns of reduced size, increased proximity to
haulouts, and increased intensity of use in the summer, but only in the
Kenai Fjords-Gulf of Alaska region.
Conclusions: This study highlights the areas of biological importance
during this vulnerable life history stage, and the demographic,
seasonal, and spatial factors associated with variation in movement
patterns for a marine mesopredator. This can be useful information for
promoting species recovery, and for future efforts to understand
ecological patterns such as predator-prey interactions.},

abstract = {Arthropod communities in fragmented agricultural landscapes depend on
local processes and the interactions between communities in the habitat
islands. We aimed to study metacommunity structure of spiders, a group
that is known for high dispersal power, local niche partitioning and for
engaging in species interactions. While living in fragmented habitats
could lead to nestedness, other ecological traits of spiders might
equally lead to patterns dominated either by species interactions or
habitat filtering. We asked, which community pattern will prevail in a
typical agricultural landscape with isolated patches of semi-natural
habitats. Such a situation was studied by sampling spiders in 28
grassland locations in a Hungarian agricultural landscape. We used the
elements of metacommunity structure (EMS) framework to distinguish
between alternative patterns that reveal community organization. The EMS
analysis indicated coherent species ranges, high turnover and boundary
clumping, suggesting Clementsian community organization. The greatest
variation in species composition was explained by local habitat
characteristics, indicating habitat filtering. The influence of
dispersal could be detected by the significant effect of landscape
composition, which was strongest at 500 m. We conclude that dispersal
allows spiders to respond coherently to the environment, creating
similar communities in similar habitats. Consistent habitat differences,
such as species rich versus species poor vegetation, lead to
recognisably different, recurrent communities. These characteristics
make spiders a predictable and diverse source of natural enemies in
agricultural landscapes. Sensitivity to habitat composition at medium
distances warns us that landscape homogenization may alter these
metacommunity processes. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published

abstract = {Disease-resistant potato varieties can play a key role in sustainable
control of potato late blight. However, when these varieties are more
widely used, resistance breakdown can occur as a result of pathogen
adaptation. Here we focussed on potato cultivation in the Netherlands,
where new (single gene) resistant varieties have been introduced over
the last ten years. This new generation of late blight resistant
varieties has moderate yield levels and does not meet all market
requirements. As a result, adoption rates for resistant varieties have
been low so far. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to
simulate potato production, disease spread and pathogen evolution at the
landscape level. We analysed how late blight severity, resistance
durability and potato yield are affected by the spatial deployment of a
resistant variety, with a lower potential yield than susceptible
varieties. The model was applied to an agricultural region in the
Netherlands (596 km(2)) and was run for a period of 36 years using daily
weather data as input for crop growth and disease dynamics. The short-
and long-term effects of the deployment of a resistant variety were
analysed with the model. With respect to short-term dynamics, years were
analysed independently to study between year variation. The model
demonstrated that in most years, susceptible fields without fungicide
application suffered severe yield losses and resistant fields performed
better despite their lower potential yield. Resistance breakdown was
observed in a small fraction of fields with the resistant variety, but
this did not affect mean potato yield or disease incidence in the short
term since it occurred at the end of the growing season. Increasing the
fraction of potato fields with the resistant variety strongly reduced
late blight infection within a landscape. With respect to the long-term
effects, the model showed the emergence and spread of a virulent strain
over time. The virulent strain gradually took over the pathogen
population, decreasing mean potato yields from fields with the resistant
variety. This occurred in all landscape compositions where the resistant
variety was deployed to different extents. It was found that low as well
as high proportions of fields with the resistant variety could increase
durability of resistance. With these findings, the model provided more
insight into the opportunities and risks related to the use of plant
resistance in disease control, an important and sustainable disease
management strategy.},

Here, we investigate whether changes in habitat conditions, dispersal limitations or competition cause variation in patterns of epiphytic species richness and turnover. LocationMadeira island. TaxonBryophytes. MethodsUsing linear mixed effect models, we test whether species richness exhibits a monotonic or hump-shaped relationship with time. Two groups of host-tree species, late- and early-successional, were considered. We further identify the mechanisms explaining the observed variation in species composition by dividing beta diversity into its nestedness ((sne)) and turnover ((sim)) components and correlating them with tree age and geographical distance among trees. ResultsThe best-fit models all included tree age (T), but its quadratic term (T-2) and tree height (H, here a surrogate of area) were not systematically included. (sim), but not (sne), correlated with host-tree age, and both (sim) and (sne) correlated with geographical distance. Main conclusionsTree age was consistently included in all of the best-fit models, reflecting the progressive increase in epiphyte bryophyte species richness through time. The limited contribution of T-2 and H to the best models suggests that competition for space is not a key factor on mature trees. The correlation of (sim), but not (sne), with host-tree age, and of (sim) and (sne) with distance among trees, suggests that variation in species composition is caused by (1) temporal community shifts due to allogenic drivers and (2) dispersal limitations, which are reflected by the higher similarity of the epiphyte communities on clustered trees rather than by an increasing probability of colonization with tree age. Since actual ancient laurel forests may no longer exist in Madeira, the conservation of clusters of late-successional trees, enhancing connectivity at small spatial scales, is of utmost importance for the conservation and recovery of the unique laurel forest epiphytic flora.},

abstract = {European landscape conservation includes the recognition of
inter-related `ancient' and `old-growth' woodland. Ancient woodland is
defined by its temporal continuity, which can be measured through its
consistent occurrence on historic maps over a period of time, typically
several centuries. Old-growth woodland has attributes of both temporal
continuity and structural complexity; European old-growth woodland is
now extremely rare and a valuable conservation resource. Indicator
species provide recognition of old-growth woodland, through traits that
are sensitive to its defining features: (i) dispersal limitation
demanding temporal continuity of suitable habitat prior to colonisation
(as is associated with ancient woodland), and/or (ii) specialist niches
associated with old and senescent trees (which may or may not be found
in ancient woodland, depending on its past management). To test the
response of indicators to each of these features, niche models were
developed for lichen epiphytes in an ancient and structurally diverse
woodland stand, thus corresponding to `old-growth' condition. Models
were projected for the ancient and an adjacent regenerated stand. There
was less suitable habitat in the regenerated stand, and a lower
proportion of suitable habitat was occupied. Nevertheless, indicators
had colonised from the ancient to the regenerated stand within 50 years.
Viewed against the background of previous work, we conclude that
landscape context the spatial relationship between ancient and
regenerated woodland is critical to the interpretation of indicators,
which are perhaps better conceptualised as markers of threat and
conservation value than independent measures of woodland history. (C)

Hymenoptera and Coleoptera, were the dominant food group in early summer
(78% volume (V), 100% frequency occurrence (F)) and mid-summer (80%
V, 100% F). A significant dietary shift occurred in late summer, when
lizards consumed predominantly plant material (63% V, 95.5% F),
consisting primarily of seasonally abundant berries from the snow beard
heath, Acrothamnus montanus. In contrast to similar-sized Egerniinae

species of microalgae have a life-history strategy that includes a
long-term resting stage, which can accumulate in sediments and serve as

differentiation in the presence of gene flow. The outcome that species
with resting stages have a higher degree of genetic differentiation

This behavior has important implications for seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and tree regeneration. Hoarders manage these caches by recovering and eating some seeds, and moving and re-caching others. This process of re-caching, however, is poorly understood. Here, we use radiotelemetry to evaluate re-caching behavior for the management of acorn caches by rodents in eastern deciduous forests. We also test the hypothesis that as seeds are re-cached, the distance from the source increases. Radio transmitters were implanted in Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns and presented to rodents in a natural setting over 3 seasons. We used radio-telemetry to track and document evidence of recovery and re-caching. We tracked a total of 102 acorns. Of the 39 radio-tagged acorns initially cached, 19 (49%) were cached on two or more occasions; one acorn was cached four times. The hypothesis that rodents move seeds to progressively greater distances from the source is not well-supported, suggesting that acorns are being moved within an individual's home range. Given the species of rodents in the study area, gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) are the most likely to be responsible for the caching and re-caching events. Gray squirrels appear to engage in extensive re-caching during periods of long-term food storage, which has important implications for understanding how caching behavior influences acorn dispersal and oak regeneration.},

Such flexibility in dispersal patterns can allow individuals greater

spatial genetic relatedness patterns across ten black bear
populations-including long established (historic), with known
reproduction >50 years ago, and newly established (recent) populations,
with reproduction recorded <50 years ago-in the Interior Highlands and
Southern Appalachian Mountains, United States. We used spatially
explicit, individual-based genetic simulations to model gene flow under
scenarios with varying levels of population density, genetic diversity,
and female philopatry. Using measures of genetic distance and spatial
autocorrelation, we compared metrics between sexes, between population
types (historic and recent), and among simulated scenarios which varied
in density, genetic diversity, and sex-biased philopatry. In empirical
populations, females in recent populations exhibited stronger patterns
of isolation-by-distance (IBD) than females and males in historic
populations. In simulated populations, low-density populations had a
stronger indication of IBD than medium-to high-density populations;
however, this effect varied in empirical populations.
Condition-dependent dispersal strategies may permit species to cope with
novel conditions and rapidly expand populations. Pattern-process

isolation by distance. Alternatively, male-mediated gene flow may have
reduced the previous regional differentiation in Central Africa
suggested by mtDNA patterns, which likely reflect forest fragmentation
during the Pleistocene. In species like elephants, male-mediated gene

near roads moved 33% farther in 2-hours periods than foxes not living
near roads. Foxes near roads move faster, range more widely, and could
more rapidly spread a pathogen throughout the island; therefore, roads
might serve as transmission corridors. We recommend reducing this risk
by increasing widths of vaccination firewalls (areas where vaccination

spatial distribution patterns than populations of phylogenetically
distant species. Additionally, variation in the abiotic and biotic
environment might result in distinct spatial distribution patterns of
local populations of the same species. We employed variation
partitioning to determine the degree to which traits, shared
evolutionary history, site characteristics, and their joint effects
govern the degree of overdispersion or aggregation of tree populations
at different spatial scales within fourteen 1-ha plots of the Atlantic
Rainforest in southeastern Brazil. We quantified the degree of
overdispersion or aggregation with a new standardized index err(r) based
on standardized effect sizes of the pair correlation function. Variation
in err(r) was mostly explained by phylogenetic relationships among
species (70-95%, depending on spatial scale), indicating that traits
not included in our analysis are important drivers of the spatial
distribution pattern. Site characteristics explained a smaller part of
the variation, indicating context-dependence. Finally, the traits
studied here provided the smallest explanation of the variation,
suggesting a minor role of seed dispersal. Residual variation in err(r)
ranged from 5-29%, indicating that stochasticity and/or variables not
included in the models (e.g. direct measures of post-dispersal
processes) also influence the spatial distribution pattern of the
populations. Our results suggest that many ecological processes act in
concert at the study site and that their importance changes with spatial
scale. Additionally, the relative importance of these processes differs
from that previously described for other tropical forests. Determining
why a given ecological process is more important in some tropical tree
communities than in others are promising venues for further research.},

creation and the relative importance of spatial and temporal scales are
poorly understood, and there is disagreement over which conservation
strategies should be prioritized. We used 160 years of historic
post-agricultural woodland creation as a natural experiment to evaluate
biodiversity responses to habitat creation in a landscape context. Birds
were surveyed in 101 secondary, broadleaf woodlands aged 10-160 years

abundance and diversity, ecological continuity, patch characteristics,

of local and landscape scales for bird communities. Ecological
continuity indirectly affected overall bird abundance and species
richness through its effects on stand structure, but had a weaker
influence (effect size near 0) on the abundance and diversity of species
most closely associated with woodland habitats. This was probably
because woodlands were rapidly colonized bywoodland generalists in <= 10
years (minimum patch age) but were on average too young (median 50
years) to be colonized by woodland specialists. Local patch
characteristics were relatively more important than landscape
characteristics for bird communities. Based on our results, biodiversity
responses to habitat creation depended on local-and landscape-scale
factors that interacted across time and space. We suggest that there is
a need for further studies that focus on habitat creation in a landscape
context and that knowledge gained from studies of habitat fragmentation
and loss should be used to inform habitat creation with caution because
the outcomes are not necessarily reciprocal.},

abstract = {Genetic responses to environmental changes take place at different
spatial scales. While the effect of environment on the distribution of
species' genetic diversity at large geographical scales has been the
focus of several recent studies, its potential effects on genetic
structure at local scales are understudied. Environmental effects on
fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) were investigated in four
Alpine conifer species (five to eight populations per species) from the
eastern Italian Alps. Significant FSGS was found for 11 of 25
populations. Interestingly, we found no significant differences in FSGS
across species but great variation among populations within species,
highlighting the importance of local environmental factors. Interannual
variability in spring temperature had a small but significant effect on
FSGS of Larix decidua, probably related to species-specific life history
traits. For Abies alba, Picea abies and Pinus cembra, linear models
identified spring precipitation as a potentially relevant climate factor
associated with differences in FSGS across populations; however, models
had low explanatory power and were strongly influenced by a P.cembra
outlier population from a very dry site. Overall, the direction of the
identified effects is according to expectations, with drier and more
variable environments increasing FSGS. Underlying mechanisms may include
climate-related changes in the variance of reproductive success and/or
environmental selection of specific families. This study provides new
insights on potential changes in local genetic structure of four Alpine
conifers in the face of environmental changes, suggesting that new
climates, through altering FSGS, may also have relevant impacts on plant
microevolution.},

transport that results from the interactions between ocean currents and
their behavioral responses to environmental changes in the course of
their life. Questions remain on the identification of key drivers of
dispersal and connectivity in marine populations as they can have
multiple uses in the conservation and management of marine ecosystems.
Here we investigate whether the open Kattegat, at the entrance to Baltic
Sea, is the main source of recruitment to the benthos in associated
estuaries and coastal sites through export of planktonic invertebrate
larvae. We couple a 3D hydrodynamic ocean model (MIKE3FM) to an
agent-based model and simulate the dispersal of macro-invertebrate
populations in Danish waters. We use characteristic dispersal traits of
the larval community (pelagic larval duration, spawning season, and
settling behavior) and simulate dispersal processes within the muddy
bottom habitats to derive recruitment rates and potential donor
populations leading to population connectivity patterns on each site,
one bay and two Danish fjords. We then use our recruitment results in
the bay to compare them with field data on species diversity in the same
area. A total of 48 different combinations of pelagic larval durations
and spawning seasons of macro-invertebrates are simulated in two years
2004 and 2010. From these results, we conclude that the central and
southern parts of the Danish waters are identified as important spawning
grounds whereas the Kattegat does not seem to be the main provider of
larvae into the selected sites. The model also predicts higher abundance
and recruitment rates of macro-invertebrate larvae in 2010 compared to
2004. These results are supported by comparable species distribution
data collected in the study area. Our results show the importance of an
integrated modeling tool combining ocean circulation and biological
traits to obtain a detailed description of dispersal and connectivity of
macro-invertebrate community in the area, which can provide a more
accurate baseline to manage marine biodiversity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. Modern literature on plant dispersal by birds focuses mainly on the importance of frugivory and scatter-hoarding, yet recent studies show that endozoochory by migratory waterbirds is an important mechanism of long-distance dispersal for a broad range of plants. Nevertheless, there is a lack of empirical field studies that identify the plants dispersed by waterbirds in a comprehensive manner. In particular, so far there are no detailed studies of the level of spatial variation in the plant taxa dispersed by a waterbird vector, and no clear demonstration that aquatic ferns can be dispersed by endozoochory. Consequently, we remain ignorant of the networks of dispersal interactions between granivorous waterbirds and plants. 2. Five sets of faecal samples (total n=215) were collected from mallards Anas platyrhynchos on autumn migration in the Hevesi-holm and Balaton regions in Hungary, central Europe. Intact diaspores were extracted, identified and their germinability assessed under standard conditions. The plant communities recorded at different sites were compared with PERMANOVA and other multivariate methods. 3. Macrospores of the floating watermoss Salvinia natans were recorded in 32 samples, and a total of 16 macrospores germinated, providing the first field demonstration of endozoochory of ferns by birds. Of 21 angiosperm taxa recorded (of which eight germinated), 13 were terrestrial species, although the most abundant taxa were aquatic species such as the alkali bulrush Bolboschoenus maritimus and the sago pondweed Potamogeton pectinatus. Two naturalized alien species, the common fig Ficus carica and the hackberry Celtis occidentalis were also recorded. Only four of the taxa had an endozoochory syndrome. The plant taxa dispersed varied at two different spatial scales, with minor but significant differences between samples from sites separated by less than 1km, and major differences between the two regions separated by c. 220km. 4. Synthesis. This is a unique study of the spatial variation in plants dispersed by endozoochory by a migratory waterfowl species, with a high taxonomic resolution and the first demonstration of avian endozoochory of ferns. We recorded eight taxa not previously reported as dispersed by mallards, showing how more empirical studies are essential, so we can understand which plants are dispersed by migratory birds. We found evidence that networks of interactions between granivorous waterbird vectors and dispersed plants vary spatially.},

abstract = {1. Disentangling ecological processes that influence community assembly
and species diversity across spatial scales remains a major goal of
community ecology. Community assembly processes influence spatial
patterns of species diversity through their interactions with key
functional traits. Hence, quantifying spatial patterns of functional
trait diversity (FD) represents a useful tool for disentangling the
relative importance of abiotic filtering, biotic interactions, random
assembly and dispersal limitation across spatial scales.
2. Here, we measured 12 traits of 112 study species in a 20-ha fully
mapped subtropical forest plot. The individuals of the 112 study species
account for 99% of all living stems with diameter at breast height >= 1
cm. We studied important functional traits related to physiological
processes of plants including resource acquisition (e.g. CO2
assimilation rate and leaf nutrient concentration) and drought tolerance
(e.g. stem hydraulic conductivity and leaf turgor loss point).
Additionally, species abundance, spatial locations (x-and y-coordinates
for each individual of the 112 study species) as well as topographic and
soil variables that represent potentially important attributes of the
physical environment of the plot were also included in our dataset.
3. We employed two FD-based tests (comparing FD within communities to
those from random communities, distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps
(MEM) and redundancy analysis-based variance partitioning), and one
spatial analysis (inhomogeneous bivariate pair correlation analysis) to
quantify the spatial patterns of FD of the plot at multiple spatial
scales (400, 900, 1,600, 2,500 and 10,000 m(2)).
4. We demonstrate that abiotic filtering is the major determinant
responsible for trait convergence at relatively small scales (400, 900
and 1,600 m(2)), whereas dispersal limitation becomes dominant, causing
the weakening of trait convergence at relatively large scales (2,500 and
10,000 m(2)).
5. Our results highlight the relative contributions of different
ecological processes to community assembly at different spatial scales,
which can be distinguished using the diversity patterns of key
functional traits. Also, our integrated approaches constitute a useful
study design to disentangle variable ecological processes in shaping
community assembly across spatial scales.},

abstract = {Aim: Evaluating the patterns of genetic variation and population
connectivity is fundamental to effectively designing and implementing
conservation strategies for threatened species. However, connectivity
patterns in highly mobile vertebrates, and especially in avian species,
are often overlooked as it is generally assumed to be driven by
demographic panmixia or isolation by distance. Herein, we investigated
the genetic structure and patterns of connectivity across four biomes in
a highly vagile bird, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus).
Location: Four major Neotropical biomes of Argentina (>300,000 km(2)):
Puna, Monte, Chaco and Patagonia.
Methods: We genotyped 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci plus one
sex-determining gene in 300 moulted feathers from 13 roosting sites in
the core of species distributional range. We quantified levels of
genetic differentiation, population structure, effective gene flow,
genetic diversity and assessed sex-biased dispersal events.
Results:We detected genetic structure with a moderate differentiation
between the north (Puna and Chaco) and south (Patagonia) regions with a
contact zone in the central area (Monte). We observed a spatial pattern
of genetic patches with higher levels of gene flow along the Andes
range. Although we found no indication of bottlenecks or inbreeding, we
observed larger effective population sizes in the south compared to the
northern region.
Main conclusions: Our study revealed that, despite the high dispersal
potential of condors, demographic panmixia is not consolidated, even in
the core of this species range. Our analyses further suggest that gene
flow rate is modulated by topographic features, as condors may disperse
more following the natural updrafts and lifts along the Andean
mountains. Conservation initiatives should prioritize the protection of
the Andean corridor to maintain connectivity between the apparent source
from Patagonia to the northern biomes.},

processes that simultaneously affect diversity at multiple biological
levels. We combined spatial and temporal sampling of 4 study sites in
the Danish Isefjord-Roskilde Fjord Estuary at 4 time points over 1 yr to
investigate the effect of seasonal variation on SGDCs. Species diversity
was estimated as species richness from samples comprising 20 752
individuals representing 51 benthic invertebrate taxa. Genetic diversity
was estimated for a single focal taxon, the polychaete Pygospio elegans,
as mean allelic richness at 7 microsatellite loci. Combining all
samples, a significant positive correlation between species richness and
allelic richness was found. Median sediment grain size and mean
temperature had significant effects on species richness, whereas only
mean temperature had a significant effect on allelic richness of P.
elegans. Our results show that both the benthic community as a whole and
populations of P. elegans respond similarly to seasonal environmental
variation at the study sites. The results suggest that seasonal timing
of reproduction and dispersal in this temperate marine habitat might
have a greater influence on diversity than spatially varying
environmental variables and highlight the benefits of also investigating
temporal SGDCs. Because of seasonal changes in diversity, it is
important that samples are compared on the same time scale when
investigating SGDCs.},

abstract = {1. Agriculture benefits from ecosystem services provided by mobile agents, such as biological pest control by natural enemies and pollination by bees. However, methods that can generate spatially explicit predictions and maps of these ecosystem services based on empirical data are still scarce. 2. Here we propose a generic statistical model to derive kernel functions to characterize the spatial distribution of ecosystem services provided by mobile agents. The model is similar in spirit to a generalized linear model, and uses data of landscape composition and ecosystem services assessed at target sites to estimate parameters of the kernel. The approach is tested in a simulation study and illustrated by an empirical case study on parasitism rates of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella. 3. The simulation study shows that the scale parameter of the exponential power kernel can be estimated with limited bias, whereas estimation of the shape parameter is difficult. For the case study the model provides biologically relevant estimates for the kernel associated with parasitism of P. xylostella. These estimates can be used to generate ecosystem service maps for existing or planned landscapes. The case study reveals that predictions can be sensitive to the parameter values for the width and shape of the kernel, and to the link function used in the statistical model. 4. In the last two decades numerous empirical studies assessed ecosystem services at target sites and related these to the surrounding landscape. Our method can take advantage of these data by estimating underlying kernels that can be used to map the spatial distribution of ecosystem services. However, empirical data that can discriminate between alternative kernel shapes remain critical.},

deposition followed by a drawdown period can promote plant community
diversity across space and time. Post-flood regeneration might be
influenced by the direct effect of flooding on seed dispersal and
seedling emergence, as well as the indirect effect of organic debris on
seed trapping and germination. Our objective was to examine the
influence of seasonal flooding, topography, and organic debris cover on
seedling distribution in a seasonally flooded grassland. We measured
species richness, seedling abundance, and organic debris cover for 3yr
in a seasonally flooded grassland in the Pantanal, Brazil, at three
topographic levels at the end of the flood season and during the dry
season when there was no debris deposition. A total of 43 species were
recorded, with no difference in species richness detected between
seasons. However, the abundance of some species was higher post-flood
than during the dry period. The greatest seedling abundance and richness
were found post-flood at intermediate elevations, followed by high and
the lowest elevations. Seed germination and seedling establishment were
likely suppressed at low topographic positions due to shading from
organic debris and poor drainage. Therefore, areas with predictable
annual floods promote diversity by creating spatial and temporal
variations in environmental conditions.

abstract = {A key focus in ecology is to search for community assembly rules. Here
we compare two community modelling frameworks that integrate a
combination of environmental and spatial data to identify positive and
negative species associations from presence-absence matrices, and
incorporate an additional comparison using joint species distribution
models (JSDM). The frameworks use a dichotomous logic tree that
distinguishes dispersal limitation, environmental requirements, and
interspecific interactions as causes of segregated or aggregated species
pairs. The first framework is based on a classical null model analysis
complemented by tests of spatial arrangement and environmental
characteristics of the sites occupied by the members of each species
pair (Classic framework). The second framework, (SDM framework)
implemented here for the first time, builds on the application of
environmentally-constrained null models (or JSDMs) to partial out the
influence of the environment, and includes an analysis of the
geographical configuration of species ranges to account for dispersal
effects. We applied these approaches to examine plot-level species
co-occurrence in plant communities sampled along a wide elevation
gradient in the Swiss Alps. According to the frameworks, the majority of
species pairs were randomly associated, and most of the non-random
positive and negative species associations could be attributed to
environmental filtering and/or dispersal limitation. These patterns were
partly detected also with JSDM. Biotic interactions were detected more
frequently in the SDM framework, and by JSDM, than in the Classic
framework. All approaches detected species aggregation more often than
segregation, perhaps reflecting the important role of facilitation in
stressful high-elevation environments. Differences between the
frameworks may reflect the explicit incorporation of elevational
segregation in the SDM framework and the sensitivity of JSDM to the
environmental data. Nevertheless, all methods have the potential to
reveal general patterns of species co-occurrence for different taxa,
spatial scales, and environmental conditions.},

Location: Neotropics.
Methods: We conducted pairwise comparisons of beta diversity of
Sapotaceae species within and between biogeographic units in the
hierarchical regionalization proposed by Morrone (2001, Biogeografia de
America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza, Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO,

Morrone (2001, Biogeografia de America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza,
Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO, Sociedad Entomologica Aragonesa (SEA)) was
biotically homogeneous with respect to all other units at the same
hierarchical level. This was the case even for units commonly reported
to be isolated and to host distinctive taxa like Choco. However, five of
45 biogeographic units were biotically homogenous relative to several
other units. These units were Cuba, Chaco, Varzea, Cauca and Costa

Main conclusions: The distribution of Sapotaceae species showed
generally low biotic homogeneity within Morrone's (2001, Biogeografia de
America Latina y el Caribe. Zaragoza, Spain: CYTED, ORCYT-UNESCO,

biogeographic units as tools for the identification of priority areas
for the conservation of biodiversity. However, relatively high biotic
homogeneity within some biogeographic units suggests that they capture
significant spatial patterns. In particular, noteworthy biotic
homogeneity within Cuba, Cauca and Costa Pacifica Mexicana could be
explained by isolation. Also, in Costa Pacifica Mexicana, patterns of
biotic homogeneity could reflect closer affinities to humid lowland
montane forest in Central America than to lowland rain forest in South
America. Finally, substantial biotic homogeneity within Varzea could
result from common adaptation to edaphic environments near the Amazon

abstract = {Whether or not individuals in cities and adjacent rural areas form separate populations depends on the origin of urbanized individuals. The rural individuals may have simply gradually invaded the city. Alternatively, the urbanization depended on arrival of individuals with specific adaptations for city life. A population within the city could also remain separated from adjacent rural populations if there are physical or behavioural dispersal barriers lowering the possibility of genetic exchange between individuals. All this is linked to dispersal behaviour of the species as gene flow is determined by distances moved during dispersal. In this study, we used microsatellite markers to evaluate whether or not Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) individuals in an urban environment are genetically separated from their sub-urban/rural counterparts. Using radio-telemetry, we also studied natal dispersal distances of urban red squirrels to evaluate the potential for gene flow within the city. We observed no indication that urban squirrels had been genetically isolated from rural squirrels. In addition, increased amount of built area did not explain differentiation between urban individuals, further indicating that there were no barriers restricting movement. Still, the genetic differentiation within the city was increased and natal dispersal distances relatively short, perhaps indicating lack of need to move long distances in the urban environment. We conclude that urban and adjacent rural squirrels were part of the same larger population with gene flow in and out from the city. Yet, urbanization was related to increased genetic differentiation, indicating different spatial genetic structure in urban and rural populations.},

abstract = {Aim: Temperate tree species overwhelmingly responded to past climate
change by migrating rather than adapting. However, past climate change
did not have the modern human-driven patterns of land use and
fragmentation, raising questions of whether tree migration will still be
able to keep pace with climate. Previous studies using coarse-grained or
randomized landscapes suggest that dispersal may be delayed but have not
identified outright barriers to migration. Here, we use real-world
fragmented landscapes at the scale of forest stands to assess the
migration capacity of eastern tree species.
Location: Eastern U.S.A.
Time period: Present day to 2100.
Major taxa studied: Eastern U.S. trees.
Methods: We simulated dispersal over 100 years for 15 species common to
the mid-Atlantic region and that are predicted to gain suitable habitat
in the northeast. In contrast to previous studies, we incorporated
greater realism with species-specific life histories and real-world
spatial configurations of anthropogenic land use. We used simulation
results to calculate dispersal rates for each species and related these
to predicted rates of species habitat shift.
Results: Our simulations suggest that land use in the human-dominated
east-coast corridor slows species dispersal rates by 12-40% and may
prevent keeping pace with climate. Species most impacted by
anthropogenic land use were often those with the highest predicted
species habitat shifts. We identified two major dispersal barriers, the
Washington DC metropolitan area and central NY, that severely impeded
tree migration.
Main conclusions: Patterns of anthropogenic land use not only slowed
migration but also resulted in effective barriers to dispersal. These
impacts were exacerbated by tree life histories, such as long ages to
maturity and narrow dispersal kernels. Without intervention, the
migration lags predicted here may lead to loss in biodiversity and
ecosystem functions as current forest species decline, and may
contribute to formation of novel communities.},

interactions is essential to identifying potential constraints on local
adaptation and for the development of effective management strategies.
We examined these issues in Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)
populations residing in the Upper Hudson River watershed of New York
State by investigating the spatial genetic structure of over 350 fish
collected from 14 different sampling locations encompassing three river
systems. Population genetic analyses of microsatellite data suggest that
fish in the area exhibit varying degrees of introgression from nearby
State-directed supplementation activities. Levels of introgression in
these populations correlate with water-way distance to stocking sites,
although genetic population structure at the level of individual
tributaries as well as their larger, parent river systems is also
detectable and is dictated by migration and influenced by habitat
connectivity. These findings represent a significant contribution to the
current literature surrounding Brook Trout migration and dispersal,
especially as it relates to larger interconnected systems. This work
also suggests that stocking activities may have far-reaching
consequences that are not directly limited to the immediate area where
stocking occurs. The framework and data presented here may aid in the
development of other local aquatic species-focused conservation plans
that incorporate molecular tools to answer complex questions regarding
diversity mapping, and genetically important conservation units.},

abstract = {Aim: Species-rich dry grasslands have declined drastically in recent
decades leading to spatial isolation of associated species. This can
disrupt gene flow leading to genetic erosion, inbreeding and increased
differentiation. Using Scabiosa canescens as a case for a threatened
central European species confined to dry grasslands, we investigate the
genetic consequences of spatial and functional isolation. In particular,
inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity are expected to be more
pronounced in populations at the northern margin of the sampling area
due to more intense agriculture, less suitable habitat and potential
post-glacial colonization from the south.
Location: Germany.
Methods: We genotyped 563 individuals at 10 microsatellite loci from 22
populations across the species' range in Germany. We analyse spatial
genetic structure and patterns of isolation by distance (IBD) at
multiple scales. Further, we identify latitudinal and altitudinal
patterns of genetic diversity and inbreeding.
Results: We found strong population differentiation but no IBD up to at
least 200 km. Levels of inbreeding were positively correlated with
latitude and tended to decline with altitude. An integration of altitude
and latitude into temperature-corrected altitude (CA) was positively
correlated with genetic diversity. Populations in the Upper Rhine Valley
appear to have a distinct ancestry.
Main conclusions: We interpret the strong population differentiation
combined with no IBD up to at least 200 km as a sign for disrupted
extensive gene flow. A trend for reduced genetic diversity towards the
northern populations occurring at lower altitudes is probably driven by
more intense land use but cannot be conclusively distinguished from
other potential factors such as a more recent colonization history.
Apart from the distinct Upper Rhine Valley populations, our findings
suggest that assisted gene flow up to 100 km would mitigate genetic
differentiation, inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity caused by
disrupted long-distance dispersal.},

reefs in southern California, USA. We combined long-term community
surveys from 86 sites with detailed environmental data to determine what
structures assemblages of fishes, invertebrates and algae at multiple
spatial scales. We identified the spatial scales of variation in species
composition using a hierarchical analysis based on eigenfunctions, and
assessed how sea surface temperature (SST), water column chlorophyll,
giant kelp biomass, wave exposure and potential propagule delivery
strength contributed to community variation at each scale. Spatial
effects occurring at multiple scales explained 60% of the variation in
fish assemblages and 52% of the variation in the assemblages of
invertebrates and algae. Most variation occurred over broad spatial
scales (> 200 km) consistent with spatial heterogeneity in SST and
potential propagule delivery strength, while the latter also explained
community variation at medium scales (65-200 km). Small scale (1-65 km)
community variation was substantial but not linked to any of the
measured drivers. Conclusions were consistent for both reef fishes and
benthic invertebrates and algae, despite sharp differences in their
adult mobility. Our results demonstrate the scale dependence of
environmental drivers on kelp forest communities, showing that most
species were strongly sorted along oceanographic conditions over various
spatial scales. Such spatial effects must be integrated into models

we tested the hypothesis that domesticated G. littoralis have suffered

CGL (21.85 +/- 0.17 g) were higher than those of the WGL fruits (14.73

significant declines relative to the WGL, presumably due to the loss of
seawater inundation, selection and dispersal. These declines disfavour
the persistence of CGL, and human domestication and cultivation are

assessed the influence of permanent grassland connectivity, described by
grassland amount and spatial configuration, on grassland biodiversity.
We selected permanent grasslands in livestock farming areas of
north-western France, which were sampled for plants, carabids and birds.
At two spatial scales we tested the effects of amount and configuration
of grasslands, wooded habitats and crops on richness and abundance of
total assemblages and species ecological groups. Grassland connectivity
had no significant effects on total richness or abundance of any
taxonomic group, regardless of habitat affinity or dispersal ability.
The amount of wooded habitat and length of wooded edges at the 200 m
scale positively influenced forest and generalist animal groups as well
as grassland plant species, in particular animal-dispersed species.
However, for animal groups such as open habitat carabids or farmland
bird specialists, the same wooded habitats negatively influenced
richness and abundance at the 500 m scale. The scale and direction of
biodiversity responses to landscape context were therefore similar among
taxonomic groups, but opposite for habitat affinity groups. We conclude
that while grassland connectivity is unlikely to contribute positively
to biodiversity, increasing or maintaining wooded elements near

profound consequences for host distributions, movement patterns, and

generalizable metapopulation model to understand how the relative
abundance of provisioned habitats across the landscape and how the host

increases patch attractiveness and disperser production and when
infection has minimal costs on dispersal success. Alternatively, if
provisioning promotes site fidelity or reduces disperser production,
increasing the fraction of food-supplemented habitats can reduce
landscape-scale infection prevalence and minimize disease-induced
declines in host occupancy. This work highlights the importance of
considering how resources and infection jointly influence host dispersal

abstract = {Body size is a fundamental trait known to allometrically scale with
metabolic rate and therefore a key determinant of individual
development, life history, and consequently fitness. In spatially
structured environments, movement is an equally important driver of
fitness. Because movement is tightly coupled with body size, we expect
habitat fragmentation to induce a strong selection pressure on size
variation across and within species. Changes in body size distributions
are then, in turn, expected to alter food web dynamics. However, no
consensus has been reached on how spatial isolation and resource growth
affect consumer body size distributions. Our aim was to investigate how
these two factors shape the body size distribution of consumers under
scenarios of size-dependent and size-independent consumer movement by
applying a mechanistic, individual-based resource-consumer model. We
also assessed the consequences of altered body size distributions for
important ecosystem traits such as resource abundance and consumer
stability. Finally, we determined those factors that explain most
variation in size distributions. We demonstrate that decreasing
connectivity and resource growth select for communities (or populations)
consisting of larger species (or individuals) due to strong selection
for the ability to move over longer distances if the movement is
size-dependent. When including size-dependent movement, intermediate
levels of connectivity result in increases in local size diversity. Due
to this elevated functional diversity, resource uptake is maximized at
the metapopulation or metacommunity level. At these intermediate levels
of connectivity, size-dependent movement explains most of the observed
variation in size distributions. Interestingly, local and spatial
stability of consumer biomass is lowest when isolation and resource
growth are high. Finally, we highlight that size-dependent movement is
of vital importance for the survival of populations or communities
within highly fragmented landscapes. Our results demonstrate that
considering size-dependent movement is essential to understand how
habitat fragmentation and resource growth shape body size

influence genetic structure across populations or social groups.
However, we still lack a thorough understanding of how these processes
and their interaction shape spatial genetic patterns over a finer scale
(tenshundreds of metres). Using uniparentally inherited markers may help
answer these questions, yet their potential has not been fully explored.
Here, we use individual-level simulations to investigate the effects of
dispersal and mating system on fine-scale genetic structure at
autosomal, mitochondrial and Y chromosome markers. Using genetic spatial
autocorrelation analysis, we found that dispersal was the major driver
of fine-scale genetic structure across maternally, paternally and
biparentally inherited markers. However, when dispersal was restricted
(mean distance=100m), variation in mating behaviour created strong
differences in the comparative level of structure detected at maternally
and paternally inherited markers. Promiscuity reduced spatial genetic
structure at Y chromosome loci (relative to monogamy), whereas structure
increased under polygyny. In contrast, mitochondrial and autosomal
markers were robust to differences in the specific mating system,
although genetic structure increased across all markers when
reproductive success was skewed towards fewer individuals. Comparing
males and females at Y chromosome vs. mitochondrial markers,
respectively, revealed that some mating systems can generate similar
patterns to those expected under sex-biased dispersal. This demonstrates
the need for caution when inferring ecological and behavioural processes
from genetic results. Comparing patterns between the sexes, across a
range of marker types, may help us tease apart the processes shaping
fine-scale genetic structure.},

White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is one of the last extant megafauna of Neotropical dry forests, but whether it serves as a legitimate seed disperser is poorly understood. We studied seed dispersal patterns and germination after white-tailed deer gut passage in a tropical dry forest in southwest Ecuador. Over 23 mo, we recorded ca 2000 seeds of 11 species in 385 fecal samples. Most seeds belonged to four species of Fabaceae: Chloroleucon mangense, Senna mollissima, Piptadenia flava, and Caesalpinia glabrata. Seeds from eight of the 11 species dispersed by white-tailed deer germinated under controlled conditions. Ingestion did not affect germination of C. mangense and S.mollissima, whereas C. glabrata showed reduced germination. Nevertheless, the removal of fruit pulp resulting from ingestion by white-tailed deer could have a deinhibition effect on germination due to seed release. Thus, white-tailed deer play an important role as legitimate seed dispersers of woody species formerly considered autochorous. Our results suggest that more research is needed to fully understand the ecological and evolutionary effects of the remaining extant megafauna on plant regeneration dynamics in the dry Neotropics.},

the collembolan community showed significant spatial autocorrelation and
aggregation on multiple spatial scales. Both communities showed
non-random co-occurrence patterns, but of different types. The carabid
community was driven by weak and insignificant topographic filtering,

topographic filtering. The two communities were each shaped by spatial
factors, but the carabid community's spatial distribution may be
regulated by their high dispersal ability, which allowed the beetles to
overcome topographic constraints. On the other hand, the collembolan
community's spatial distribution may be regulated by their dispersal
limitations, which combine with topographic constraints to create an
aggregation pattern. Finally, we conclude that the dominant AG and BG

fragmentation pattern of this region using a multi-scale perspective.
Using the Brazilian official database of native remnants, we calculated
the number and percentage of remaining fragments per size class and we
describe how habitat amount changes along the landscape. By simulating
different dispersal capacities, we estimated the functional connectivity
among remnants. We also calculated the cumulative core area as a

Caatinga is subdivided into 47,100 fragments. Although 91% of them are
smaller than 500 ha, 720 fragments are larger than 10,000 ha,
corresponding to 78% of the remaining vegetation. Potentially, 95% of
the vegetation is accessible to species that can cross 1000 m of matrix.
With one kilometer of edge effect, the core area is reduced to a quarter
of the remaining vegetation. The habitat amount analyzes reinforced the
regional differences in the spatial distribution of the remnants.
Caatinga remains well connected for species with moderate and high

challenged. For Mendacibombus bumblebees, high-elevation specialists
with distributions centred on the QTP, we examine broader explanations.
We extend integrative biogeography to cover multiple contributing
factors by using a framework of sequential filters: 1) molecular
evidence from four genes is used to estimate phylogenetic relationships,
with time calibration from a published estimate; 2) spatial evidence
from current distributions is combined with the phylogeny and
constrained by a model of short-distance dispersal along mountain
corridors to estimate ancestral distributions by both S-DIVA and S-DEC
analysis; 3) geological evidence from the literature is used to
constrain when high mountain ranges were uplifted to become potential
corridors; and 4) climatological evidence from Mendacibombus
niche-evolution reconstructions and from palaeoclimate simulations is
used to constrain when habitat was suitable in key gaps within
corridors. Explanations for Mendacibombus distributions can be
identified that require only short-distance dispersal along mountain
corridors, commensurate with the limited dispersal ability observed for
bumblebees. These explanations depend on the timing of uplift of
mountain ranges, regional climate change, and climate-niche evolution.
The uplift of the QTP may have contributed to the initial Oligocene
divergence of the common ancestor of Mendacibombus from other
bumblebees, but for the first two thirds of the history of
Mendacibombus, only a single lineage has present-day descendants.
Divergence of multiple extant Mendacibombus lineages coincided with the
Late Miocene-Pliocene uplift of externally connecting mountains,
combined with regional climate cooling. These changes provided greater
connectivity of suitable habitat, allowing these bumblebees to disperse
out of the western QTP via new high bridges, escaping along the mountain
corridors of the Tian Shan and Hindu Kush ranges, reaching eventually
far to the west (Iberian Peninsula) and to the north-east (Kamchatka).},

results show that black-tufted marmoset tend to occupy forest fragments

We examined how the spatial ecology of this biota, particularly distance-decay and species-area relationships, could better inform habitat thresholds for EMF conservation planning. Location: Southeast Vancouver Island near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Methods: Using a stratified sampling design, 11 plots (0.15ha in size) were established at 0.05-17.5km apart across 2,800ha of mesic old-growth Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii and Tsuga heterophylla forests. EMF communities were compiled through molecular analysis of root tips and sporocarps. Results: The EMF community was comprised of many Cortinarius, Piloderma, Russula and Tricholoma species typical of mesotrophic habitat. A total of 238 EMF species were observed, of which 86 species were detected only once. The ratio of average species richness per plot (84 taxa) to total richness was low at 0.35, and inherent stochasticity of the EMF community was estimated to be 31% community dissimilarity for species incidence. Distance decay of EMF communities was nonlinear, with an estimated slope break at 2.6km, followed by a largely unchanging trend in -diversity. Accumulated species-area curves were fitted best by the cumulative Weibull sigmoid model, and the asymptote (367 species) at approx. 50ha was consistent with nonparametric estimates of -diversity (342-362 spp.). Main conclusions: Old-growth forests host an impressive amount of EMF diversity, and many of the Ramaria, Inocybe and Russula species are likely to be endemic to the Pacific Northwest.

abstract = {Dragonflies reside in both aquatic and terrestrial environments,
depending on their life stage, necessitating the conservation of
drastically different habitats; however, little is understood about how
nymph and adult dragonflies function as metapopulations within connected
habitat. We used genetic techniques to examine nymphs and adults within
a single metapopulation both spatially and temporally to better
understand metapopulation structure and the processes that might
influence said structure. We sampled 97 nymphs and 149 adult Sympetrum
obtrusum from eight locations, four aquatic, and four terrestrial, at
the Pierce Cedar Creek Institute in Southwest Michigan over two summers.
We performed AFLP genetic analysis and used the Bayesian analysis
program STRUCTURE to detect genetic clusters from sampled individuals.
STRUCTURE detected k=u4 populations, in which nymphs and adults from the
same locations collected in different years did not necessarily fall
into the same clusters. We also evaluated grouping using the statistical
clustering analyses NMDS and MRPP. The results of these confirmed
findings from STRUCTURE and emphasized differences between adults
collected in 2012 and all other generations. These results suggest that
both dispersal and a temporal cycle of emergence of nymphs from unique
clusters every other year could be influential in structuring dragonfly
populations, although our methods were not able to fully distinguish the
influences of either force. This study provides a better understanding
of local dragonfly metapopulation structure and provides a starting
point for future studies to investigate the spatial and temporal
mechanisms controlling metapopulation structure. The results of the
study should prove informative for managers working to preserve genetic
diversity in connected dragonfly metapopulations, especially in the face
of increasing anthropogenic landscape changes.},

on an area of the California Current off the coast of central

proximity to both open coast and bay habitats. While multiyear studies

Current remained consistent across years-the oceanographic environment
affected meroplankton distributions along complex shoreline topography
but not across the shelf. Chlorophyll fluorescence and variables
associated with regional upwelling were most correlated with larval
distributions, indicating an association between larval distributions
and primary production. We also found that environmental variability did
not explain much of the variability in the larval distributions (only 5

mediated the role of physical forcing in determining larval

larval transport and survival, adding to our understanding of how marine

abstract = {Conservation and management activities are always constrained by finite
resources. Therefore, decisions such as which sites to protect, whether
existing habitat should be restored or whether new habitat should be
created, and where on the landscape management efforts should be focused
present difficult challenges. An overarching goal of many conservation
or management plans is the long-term persistence of populations, which
is often dependent on functional connectivity and the maintenance of
metapopulation dynamics. Graph theory and network approaches are
frequently used tools for modeling functional connections between
populations and between habitats. Less often, graph models are used to
guide conservation or management decisions. We used spatial networks
derived for an amphibian population to determine optimal locations to
create new habitat, prioritize existing habitat for restoration, and
determine the habitat most critical for maintaining connectivity within
the existing metapopulation within Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, USA,
2012-2014. Using data collected at 206 breeding ponds over 3 years, we
constructed demographic networks representing the functional
connectivity between ponds by dispersing ringed salamanders (Ambystoma
annulatum). We incorporated uncertainty in key model parameters through
Monte Carlo simulation, and used a graph-theoretical parameterization of
the metapopulation mean lifetime model to assess how changes in network
structure affect persistence of the network. We conducted addition and
removal experiments within our Monte Carlo simulations to rank and
prioritize locations for pond creation, ponds for restoration, and ponds
for preservation. Salamanders bred in 106 ponds in 1 year; 2.4% of
ponds functioned predominantly as sources and 51% of occupied ponds
functioned predominantly as sinks. The importance of a pond to the
network was correlated with the number of emigrants dispersing from a
pond, the number of ponds reached by these dispersers, and the frequency
a pond functioned as a source. Creating new ponds at optimal locations
increased the persistence of the network an average of 15.4% compared
to randomly selected locations, whereas selective restoration of
currently unoccupied ponds resulted in an average increase of 31.4% in
network persistence, as compared to randomly selected unoccupied ponds.
Through Monte Carlo simulation, we constructed biologically informed
demographic connectivity networks for use as a spatial conservation or
management planning tool. Although our approach was implemented with an
amphibian and a breeding pond network, it is generalizable to any
species occupying discrete habitat patches. (c) 2017 The Wildlife

Demographic network models have potential as a spatial conservation
planning and management tool. Management decisions based on demographic
network models may improve connectivity and long-term persistence of a

We identify conservation priority areas for current and future projected

protected area networks (national protected areas and Natura 2000); (ii)
threatened by agricultural or urban land-use changes.
We use outputs of species distributions models fitted with climatic data
as inputs in spatial prioritization tools to identify conservation
priority areas for 168 bird species. We use projections of land-use
change to then discriminate between threatened and non-threatened
priority areas.
19% of the priority areas for birds are covered by national protected
areas and 23% are covered by Natura 2000 sites. The spatial mismatch
between protected area networks and priority areas for birds is
projected to increase with climate change. But there are opportunities
to improve the protection of birds under climate change, as half of the
priority areas are currently neither protected nor in conflict with
urban or agricultural land-uses.
We identify critical areas for bird conservation both under current and

This is because selection via, both indirect (e.g. relaxed selection or island syndromes) and direct (e.g. natural selection or spatial sorting) processes may be involved, and no study has yet convincingly distinguished between these alternatives. Here, we combined observational and experimental analyses of an island lizard, the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis, the world's largest lizard), to provide evidence for the actions of multiple processes that could contribute to island dispersal loss. In the Komodo dragon, concordant results from telemetry, simulations, experimental translocations, mark-recapture, and gene flow studies indicated that despite impressive physical and sensory capabilities for long-distance movement, Komodo dragons exhibited near complete dispersal restriction: individuals rarely moved beyond the valleys they were born/captured in. Importantly, lizard site-fidelity was insensitive to common agents of dispersal evolution (i.e. indices of risk for inbreeding, kin and intraspecific competition, and low habitat quality) that consequently reduced survival of resident individuals. We suggest that direct selection restricts movement capacity (e.g. via benefits of spatial philopatry and increased costs of dispersal) alongside use of dispersal-compensating traits (e.g. intraspecific niche partitioning) to constrain dispersal in island species.},

topic in the study of biogeography and can help illuminate the processes

patterns have been well documented, there remains much uncertainty over
the causes of beta diversity patterns across elevational gradients. We
conducted bird surveys and obtained high-resolution climatic data along
an elevational gradient in Gyirong Valley in the central Himalayas,
China, between 1,800 and 5,400 m elevation. In total, we recorded 182
bird species (including 169 breeding birds). We simulated beta diversity
patterns with the mid-domain effect (MDE) null model and conducted
distance-based redundancy analyses (db-RDA) to relate beta diversity to
dispersal limitations, spatial constraints, habitat complexity,
contemporary climate, and historical climate. Mantel tests and variation
partitioning were employed to identify the magnitude of independent
statistical associations of environmental factors with beta diversity.
Patterns of empirical and simulated beta diversity were both
hump-shaped, peaking at intermediate elevations. The db-RDA indicated
that beta diversity was correlated with changes in spatially structured
environmental factors, especially with contemporary climate and habitat
complexity. Mantel tests and variation partitioning also suggested that
climate dissimilarity was the major independent correlate of beta
diversity. The random community structure and spatial constraints may
also contribute to the overall hump-shaped pattern. Beta diversity of
bird communities in Gyirong Valley could be explained by the combination
of different factors but is mainly shaped by the spatially structured
environmental factors, especially contemporary climate.},

incorporating varying proportions of marked individuals on model

models to incorporate variation in density as a function of land

in bear densities and housing density as obtained using SCR.
Incorporating individual detection data from simultaneous non-invasive

4. Synthesis and applications. Our results identify contexts in which
camera count data can be used as an alternative to spatial
capture-recapture (SCR) when individual identification is prohibitive.
Spatial count models provided an accurate, but less precise replication

abstract = {Question The composition of fruit types, fleshy vs dry fruits, greatly influences the functioning of plant communities. Literature documenting spatial patterns of fruit types at fine scale is abundant. However, studies at larger geographical scale remain scarce, especially on high-elevation oceanic islands that provide a great environmental heterogeneity. Here, we investigated how abiotic factors explained the proportion of fleshy-fruited species (pFF) on Reunion. We asked (a) which abiotic factors were most related to pFF, (b) if fleshy-fruited canopy species were more sensitive than fleshy-fruited shrubs to harsh climatic conditions and (c) what are the relationships between pFF, endemism and phylogenetic relatedness. LocationMethodsReunion (3,070m a.s.l), Mascarene archipelago, South-West Indian Ocean. We used a dataset of 429 vegetation plots and assigned fruit types, growth forms and geographical distribution to 213 native woody species. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for each plot. We used GLMs to measure the relationship between pFF and abiotic factors, controlling for spatial autocorrelation. We then assessed the relationship between pFF, the standardized net relatedness index and the proportion of endemic species. ResultsConclusionsThe top model explained 78% of the variation in pFF. Elevation was by far the best predictor, with pFF decreasing from 81% at 50m a.s.l to 0% at 3,000m a.s.l. At low elevations, pFF was higher on the wet windward (81%) than on the leeward (70%) where phylogenetic clustering was evident. Almost half (48%) of woody plants was fleshy-fruited trees at low elevations. The proportion of fleshy-fruited trees declined sharply with elevation and was significantly related to precipitation of the driest month contrary to the proportion of fleshy-fruited shrubs that showed a hump shaped pattern along elevational gradient and no correlation with precipitation of the driest month. At high elevations, most plant assemblages were phylogenetically clustered and strongly dominated by single-island endemic dry-fruited plants. The striking relationship between pFF and elevation, the shift among fleshy-fruited growth forms along climatic gradients and the phylogenetic clustering of assemblages subjected to harsh climatic conditions, suggested that climatic factors were the main drivers of the distribution of fruit types on Reunion. To explain the absence of fleshy-fruited species at high elevations, we hypothesized that native fleshy-fruited lineages lacked the evolutionary potential to adapt and fleshy-fruited cold-adapted lineages had major difficulties reaching Reunion.},

across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences,
this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover

turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection,
increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream

competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in
terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient
of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.},

hypotheses that (1) common herbaceous and woody species do not respond
individualistically to environmental factors, but rather form groups of
species with similar environmental affinities (archetypes), and (2) if
local communities comprised cohesive systems, then archetypes of common
species will occupy distinct portions of the coast with little or no
overlap. We used a large set of climatic and soil variables in restinga
heath vegetation along similar to 9000 km of eastern South American
coastal plains. We used species archetype models, a new statistical
approach that clusters species based on their environmental responses.
We found five herbaceous species archetypes and 11 woody species
archetypes, all responsive significantly although weakly to a mixture of
climatic and soil variables. In most cases, there was considerable
spatial overlap of different archetypes rather than separation along the
coastline. Common species form groups with similar environmental
affinities, but that did not respond strongly to environmental factors.
This suggests an important role for dispersal in the explanation of
heath vegetation floristic variation. Local community composition is
influenced by groups of species that arc not unique to any region and
overlap extensively. Restinga heath vegetation communities seem to be
considerably individualistic rather than cohesive systems.},

the last 8ka? Have they been consistent over time? What are the
long-term diversity trends at different sites? Is there a consistent
rate-of-change between sites?
LocationThirty sites in Norway, two sites in north-west Sweden.
MethodsPollen data from these 32 lakes. The sites lie within six of the
vegetation zones of Moen (1998). The data are used to estimate pollen
diversity using Hills effective species numbers N0, N1 and N2. Diversity
relationships in time and along latitude are assessed using ANCOVA.
Linear regression is used to investigate site-independent long-term
trends. Patterns in the regression slopes are investigated between
vegetation zones and along the latitudinal gradient.
ResultsThe latitudinal pattern of decreasing diversity with increasing
latitude existed over the last 8ka, although for the number of
effectively common (N1) and abundant (N2) pollen taxa the relationship
was slightly weaker between 8-6ka. Long-term trends show that diversity
increases at most sites over time. However, the magnitude and
rate-of-change vary between sites. Highest rate-of-change in N0 over
time is observed in southern sites, although the spatial relationship of
rate-of-change is not statistically significant.
ConclusionsThe constant increase in diversity over time may reflect
additional taxa arriving and changes in abundances. Most sites change in
the same direction, but at different rates and magnitudes. There is no
clear spatial pattern in rate-of-change, and the general patterns of
increasing diversity over time are consistent with the hypothesis of
post-glacial (Holocene) dispersal limitation. Drivers of these changes
have not been rigorously investigated, but our results suggest that
environmental and historical processes are not mutually exclusive.
During the last 2-1ka BP diversity patterns have probably been
increasingly affected by human land use.},

In this study, we used the common reed (Phragmites australis), a grass
native in Europe and invading North America, to examine the relative
importance of geographic, environmental (represented by climate here),
and human effects on population genetic structure and its changes during
invasion. We collected samples of P.australis from both the invaded
North American and native European ranges and used molecular markers to
investigate the population genetic structure within and between ranges.
We used path analysis to identify the contributions of each of the three
factorsgeographic, environmental, and human-relatedto the formation of
spatial genetic patterns. Genetic differentiation was observed between
the introduced and native populations, and their genetic structure in
the native and introduced ranges was different. There were strong
effects of geography and environment on the genetic structure of
populations in the native range, but the human-related factors
manifested through colonization of anthropogenic habitats in the
introduced range counteracted the effects of environment. The
between-range genetic differences among populations were mainly
explained by the heterogeneous environment between the ranges, with the
coefficient 2.6 times higher for the environment than that explained by
the geographic distance. Human activities were the primary contributor
to the genetic structure of the introduced populations. The significant
environmental divergence between ranges and the strong contribution of
human activities to the genetic structure in the introduced range
suggest that invasive populations of P.australis have evolved to adapt
to a different climate and to human-made habitats in North America.},

abstract = {Reticulitermes flavipes is an invasive termite from North America that
is found in several European countries, including France from north to
south. It feeds on several timber species and can cause major damage
when it infests lumber. Termites are urban pests: they are often found
in and around towns and their expansion is closely linked to human
activity. Although, by law, termite infestations must be reported and
treated, R. flavipes continues to spread. To better identify areas that
may soon be colonized, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms
underlying the termite's spread at a fine spatial scale. However, the
complexity of the species' dispersal dynamics (i.e., via swarming,
budding, or human-mediated transport of infested material) and social
organization render this process difficult. The goal of our study was to
determine R. flavipes' potential to expand its current range within a
region of France: Centre-Val de Loire. We focused on one administrative
department within the region-Indre and Loire-where infestations are
common and data on termite presence date back to the 1980s. We developed
a spatiotemporal model to study the growth and dispersal of termite
colonies within favorable habitat. Habitat favorability was defined
based on the density of urbanization and annual mean minimum
temperature. First, we modeled temporal population dynamics, using
biological parameters describing the transitions between life
stages/castes within colonies; we could thus estimate alates production.
Then, using this information, we modeled termite dispersal within
favorable habitat, and determined the termite's potential spread. We
validated the results by comparing the model's output with actual data
on the termite's range expansion between 1985 (when the termite was
first observed in the region) and 2013. Finally, the model was used to
predict the termite's future spread given climate warming for the period
from 2013 to 2030. The results show that an increase in temperature
should increase the amount of favorable habitat and, as a consequence,
termites could continue to spread within this region. In addition to
continuing current control efforts, it will be necessary to enact
preventative strategies in newly favorable habitat. In these areas,
monitoring efforts should therefore be intensified, as they might be
able to slow down the termite's spread and limit its impact.},

abstract = {AimThis study analyses the places and the scales at which the
latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) for vertebrate species holds or,
conversely, fails. Although much empirical support for the LDG at a
global scale exists, several marked departures have also been previously
reported for some regions, scales and organisms. Here, we aim to test
the generality of the LDG by accurately quantifying its variability
among regions and scales using a novel analysing approach applied on
environmental and species data.
LocationGlobal; Vertebrate species (amphibians, mammals and birds).
MethodsTo test the LDG, we proceeded in two successive steps. First, we
collected environmental and vertebrate species data to summarize the
overall environment (likely the LDG). In a second step, we compared the
two datasets (environment and species biodiversity index maps) using the
Comparison Map and Profile (CMP) method. It computes the correlation
between datasets in moving windows, all over both maps (at one scale),
and by increasing the size (scale) of the moving windows.
Cross-correlations are then spatially computed through all scales in
order to map and accurately quantify the relationship between
environment and biodiversity on Earth.
ResultsThe best environmental variable, explaining almost 70% of the
spatial variation in vertebrate species richness, was the temperature
seasonality composite (TSC), a good surrogate candidate for the LDG.
While the TSC-diversity relationship followed an expected LDG-like
pattern in the Southern Hemisphere and in the tropics, it showed
significant departures from latitudinal trends in Asia and North
America. This observation can be explained by the increase in animal
species number with increasing northern latitudes.
Main conclusionsWe showed that the LDG (i.e. through the TSC surrogate)
relationship fails in many places and at all scales in average. We must
then reject the mainstream hypothesis of the overall worldwide LDG
pattern. We suggest that it should not be taken for granted in
macroecological studies, especially over the Northern Hemisphere. The
spatial distribution of vertebrate richness is both area and scale
dependent, and this observation is robust to changes in spatial
resolution, in data coverage (e.g. ecoregions) and in taxa.},

two metacommunity scales using data from 16 regions across the world.
More specifically, we examined (a) whether the lake macrophyte
communities respond similar to key local environmental factors, major
climate variables and lake spatial locations in each of the regions
(i.e., within-region approach) and (b) how well can explained
variability in the community-environment relationships across multiple
lake macrophyte metacommunities be accounted for by elevation range,
spatial extent, latitude, longitude, and age of the oldest lake within
each metacommunity (i.e., across-region approach). In the within-region
approach, we employed partial redundancy analyses together with
variation partitioning to investigate the relative importance of local
variables, climate variables, and spatial location on lake macrophytes
among the study regions. In the across-region approach, we used adjusted
R-2 values of the variation partitioning to model the
community-environment relationships across multiple metacommunities
using linear regression and commonality analysis. We found that niche
filtering related to local lake-level environmental conditions was the
dominant force structuring macrophytes within metacommunities. However,
our results also revealed that elevation range associated with climate
(increasing temperature amplitude affecting macrophytes) and spatial
location (likely due to dispersal limitation) was important for
macrophytes based on the findings of the across-metacommunities
analysis. These findings suggest that different determinants influence
macrophyte metacommunities within different regions, thus showing
context dependency. Moreover, our study emphasized that the use of a
single metacommunity scale gives incomplete information on the
environmental features explaining variation in macrophyte communities.},

abstract = {Due to increasing habitat fragmentation and concern about its ecological
effects, there has been an upsurge in the use of landscape connectivity
estimates in conservation planning. Measuring connectivity is
challenging, resulting in a limited understanding of the efficacy of
connectivity estimation techniques and the conditions under which they
perform best. We evaluated the performance of four commonly used
connectivity metrics - Euclidean distance; least-cost paths (LCP) length
and cost; and circuit theory's resistance distance - over a variety of
simulated landscapes. We developed an agent-based model simulating the
dispersal of individuals with different behavioural traits across
landscapes varying in their spatial structure. The outcomes of multiple
dispersal attempts were used to obtain `true' connectivity. These `true'
connectivity measures were then compared to estimates generated using
the connectivity metrics, employing the simulated landscapes as
cost-surfaces. The four metrics differed in the strength of their
correlation with true connectivity; resistance distance showed the
strongest correlation, closely followed by LCP cost, with Euclidean
distance having the weakest. Landscape structure and species behavioural
attributes only weakly predicted the performance of resistance distance,
LCP cost and length estimates, with none predicting Euclidean distance's
efficacy. Our results indicate that resistance distance and LCP cost
produce the most accurate connectivity estimates, although their
absolute performance under different conditions is difficult to predict.
We emphasise the importance of testing connectivity estimates against
patterns derived from independent data, such as those acquired from
tracking studies. Our findings should help to inform a more refined
implementation of connectivity metrics in conservation management. (C)

understand the diversity, composition and spatial structure of
N2O-reducing microbial assemblages in forest soils across a large
latitudinal and temperature gradient.
2. We sequenced nosZ gene amplicons of 126 soil samples from six forests
with mean annual soil temperatures (MAST) ranging from 3.7 to 25.3
degrees C and tested predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology
(MTE) and metabolic-niche theory (MNT). As predicted, -diversity of nosZ
communities increased with increasing MAST, within-site -diversity
decreased and two (pH and soil moisture) of the three niche widths
examined were larger with increasing MAST.
3. We calculated -nearest taxon distance and Raup-Crick metric to
quantify the relative influence of the assembly processes determining
nosZ assemblage structure. Environmental selection was the primary
process driving assemblage structure in all six forests. Homogenizing
dispersal was also important at one site, which could be explained by
the site's much lower variability in soil chemistry.
4. We used canonical correspondence analysis and multiple regression on
matrices to examine relationships between nosZ communities and
environmental factors, and found that temperature and spatial distance
were significant predictors of nosZ assemblage structure.
5. Overall our results support both theories (MTE and MNT) tested,
showing that higher temperatures are correlated with higher local
diversity, wider niche breadths and lower within-site turnover rates.},

abstract = {1. Declines of large vertebrates in tropical forests may reduce
dispersal of tree species that rely on them, and the resulting
undispersed seedlings might suffer increased distance- and
density-dependent mortality. Consequently, extirpation of large
vertebrates may alter the composition and spatial structure of plant
communities and impair ecosystem functions like carbon storage.
2. We analysed spatial patterns of tree recruitment within six forest
plots along a defaunation gradient in western Amazonia. We divided
recruits into two size cohorts (saplings: 1m tall and <1cm diameter at
breast height {[}dbh], and juveniles, 1-2cm dbh) and examined the
spatial organisation of conspecific recruits within each cohort
(within-cohort) and around conspecific reproductive-sized trees
(between-cohort). We used replicated spatial point pattern analysis to
quantify relationships between recruit clustering and cohort,
defaunation intensity, each tree species reliance on hunted dispersers
and the interactions among these three covariates.
3. Within-cohort clustering of conspecific saplings increased with
reliance of tree species on hunted dispersers, and this trend
strengthened significantly as defaunation increased, probably because of
reduced dispersal.
4. Within-cohort clustering of conspecifics declined from saplings to
juveniles, suggesting density-dependent mortality of saplings. However,
the positive relationship between sapling clustering and defaunation did
not lead to greater reductions in within-cohort clustering during the
sapling-juvenile transition, suggesting that higher conspecific
densities did not translate into increased mortality. Instead, the
increased spatial clustering associated with defaunation was retained
for juvenile recruits.
5. Between-cohort clustering was unrelated to defaunation and did not
change during the sapling-juvenile transition.
6. Synthesis. Defaunation increased spatial aggregation of saplings of
tree species reliant on hunted dispersers. The increase in sapling
clustering did not increase density-dependent thinning, and persisted
into older recruit cohorts, suggesting that hunting may initiate
long-term spatial reorganisation of Amazonian tree communities. The lack
of increased density-dependent thinning indicates that reduced dispersal
did not increase mortality of large-vertebrate dispersed tree species
that contribute disproportionately to forest biomass. We, therefore,
caution against the fait accompli acceptance of the prediction by recent
modelling studies that overhunting will precipitate a collapse in carbon
sequestration by tropical forests.},

located in deep-sea volcanic calderas are predicted to differ more than
between vents on mid-ocean ridges, as caldera walls are expected to act
as barriers to dispersal. However, taxonomic information on hydrothermal
vent meiofauna in volcanic calderas is limited. Here, we investigated
the spatial variation in benthic copepod taxonomic composition and its
association with selected environmental parameters, including food
resources, on chimney structures of vent sites in the calderas of 3
neighboring sea knolls (Bayonnaise Knoll, Myojin Knoll, and Myojin-sho
Caldera) on the Izu-Ogasawara Arc, northwestern Pacific Ocean. Spatial
differences in order-level copepod taxonomic composition were
significantly correlated with differences in stable carbon isotopic
signatures (delta C-13) of organic matter in the detritus of vent sites;
these values reflected the relative contribution of carbon substrates in
the vent fluid. The availability of vent chemoautotrophic carbon may
have been the primary and a common factor controlling copepod assemblage
composition at high taxonomic levels around the hydrothermal vents on
these 3 knolls. We also found a bathymetric pattern in the abundance of
Stygiopontius senokuchiae, a species of copepod in Dirivultidae specific
to vents. While this species dominated Bayonnaise Knoll and Myojin-sho
Caldera (depth of 740-800 m), their densities were lower in the deeper
Myojin Knoll (depth 1250-1320 m). Our results suggest that the caldera
wall may not be a significant dispersal barrier for vent copepods;
instead, water depth and chemoautotrophic food resource availability are
likely the key factors controlling vent copepod distributions.},

the distribution and fitness of individuals is a fundamental aspect of

assessing habitat quality, a comprehensive understanding of habitat
quality in heterogeneous landscapes requires estimates of dispersal
rates among habitat types. The increasing accessibility of genomic
approaches, combined with field-based demographic methods, provides
novel opportunities for incorporating dispersal estimation into
assessments of habitat quality. In this study, we integrated genomic
kinship approaches with field-based estimates of fitness components and
approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) procedures to estimate
habitat-specific dispersal rates and characterize habitat quality in
two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) occurring in a Costa Rican
agricultural ecosystem. Field-based observations indicated that birth
and survival rates were similar in a sparsely shaded cacao farm and
adjacent cattle pasture-forest mosaic. Sloth density was threefold
higher in pasture compared with cacao, whereas home range size and
overlap were greater in cacao compared with pasture. Dispersal rates
were similar between the two habitats, as estimated using ABC procedures
applied to the spatial distribution of pairs of related individuals
identified using 3,431 single nucleotide polymorphism and 11
microsatellite locus genotypes. Our results indicate that crops produced
under a sparse overstorey can, in some cases, constitute lower-quality
habitat than pasture-forest mosaics for sloths, perhaps because of
differences in food resources or predator communities. Finally, our
study demonstrates that integrating field-based demographic approaches
with genomic methods can provide a powerful means for characterizing
habitat quality for animal populations occurring in heterogeneous

dominant driver for determining meta-community structure at fine

been challenged by a recently proposed fine-scale species sorting
hypothesis, where community structure can be largely determined by an
environmental gradient formed by local pollution at fine scales. Here,
we tested this hypothesis by studying community composition and
geographical distribution of metazoan zooplankton in a heavily polluted
riverthe North Canal River in the Haihe River Basin, China. Analysis of
similarity (ANOSIM) showed that the community composition of metazoan
zooplankton differed significantly (p=.001) along the environmental
gradient. Ammonium (NH4-N) was the leading factor responsible for
changes in zooplankton community structure and geographical
distribution, followed by total dissolved solid (TDS), Na, dissolved
oxygen (DO) and temperature (T). Variation partitioning revealed a
larger contribution of environmental variables (21.6%) than spatial
variables (1.1%) to the total explained variation of zooplankton
communities. Our results support that species sorting, rather than
dispersal, played a key role in structuring communities. Threshold
Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) also revealed significant change points
at both taxon and community levels along the gradient of NH4-N,
providing further support for the influence of environmental variables

on matching the spatial scales of population demography, local
adaptation, and threat mitigation. For marine fish with high dispersal
capabilities, this remains a fundamental challenge. Based on daily
parentage assignments of more than 4,000 offspring, we document
fine-scaled temporal differences in individual reproductive success for
two spatially adjacent (<10 km) populations of a broadcast-spawning
marine fish. Distinguished by differences in genetics and life history,
Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) from inner- and outer-fjord populations were
allowed to compete for mating and reproductive opportunities. After
accounting for phenotypic variability in several traits, reproductive
success of outer-fjord cod was significantly lower than that of
inner-fjord cod. This finding, given that genomically different cod
ecotypes inhabit inner- and outer-fjord waters, raises the intriguing
hypothesis that the populations might be diverging because of ecological
speciation. Individual reproductive success, skewed within both sexes
(more so among males), was positively affected by body size, which also
influenced the timing of reproduction, larger individuals spawning later
among females but earlier among males. Our work suggests that spatial
mismatches between management and biological units exist in marine
fishes and that studies of reproductive interactions between putative
populations or ecotypes can provide an informative basis on which
determination of the scale of local adaptation can be ascertained.},

sharp environmental gradient between rainforest and sandy plains does
not seem to have affected the colonization and migration dynamics in A.

neighbouring habitats in both chloroplast and nuclear data despite the
striking differences in environmental conditions. This result is
consistent with a scenario of repeated colonization of the sandy coastal

maintenance of gene flow between habitats through pollination. We also
recovered a broad north/south population structure that has been found
in other Atlantic rainforest groups and possibly reflects older

among nearby males higher than that among nearby females, as predicted
by observations of male-biased philopatry. This kin structure creates
opportunities for failed breeders to gain indirect fitness benefits via
redirected helping, but crucially, most close neighbours of failed
breeders are unrelated and help is directed towards relatives more often
than expected by indiscriminate helping. These findings are consistent
with the effective kin discrimination mechanism known to exist in

Here, we used variation partitioning and null model analysis to compare mechanisms driving bacterial and protist metacommunity dynamics at the basin scale in the East China Sea, based on MiSeq paired-end sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and 18S rDNA, respectively, in surface, deep chlorophyll maximum and bottom layers. Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them. Our findings support the `size-plasticity' hypothesis: smaller organisms (bacteria) are less environment filtered than larger organisms (protists), as smaller organisms are more likely to be plastic in metabolic abilities and have greater environmental tolerance.},

those from lowlands, where fragmentation of natural habitats has
occurred in the last decades. In these cases, despite some limitations,

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and climate change are both prominent
manifestations of global change, but there is little knowledge on the
specific mechanisms of how climate change may modify the effects of
habitat fragmentation, for example, by altering dynamics of spatially
structured populations. The long-term viability of metapopulations is
dependent on independent dynamics of local populations, because it
mitigates fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole.
Metapopulation viability will be compromised if climate change increases
spatial synchrony in weather conditions associated with population
growth rates. We studied a recently reported increase in metapopulation
synchrony of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in the
Finnish archipelago, to see if it could be explained by an increase in
synchrony of weather conditions. For this, we used 23years of butterfly
survey data together with monthly weather records for the same period.
We first examined the associations between population growth rates
within different regions of the metapopulation and weather conditions
during different life-history stages of the butterfly. We then examined
the association between the trends in the synchrony of the weather
conditions and the synchrony of the butterfly metapopulation dynamics.
We found that precipitation from spring to late summer are associated
with the M. cinxia per capita growth rate, with early summer conditions
being most important. We further found that the increase in
metapopulation synchrony is paralleled by an increase in the synchrony
of weather conditions. Alternative explanations for spatial synchrony,
such as increased dispersal or trophic interactions with a specialist
parasitoid, did not show paralleled trends and are not supported. The
climate driven increase in M. cinxia metapopulation synchrony suggests
that climate change can increase extinction risk of spatially structured
populations living in fragmented landscapes by altering their dynamics.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the mechanisms that drive beta diversity (i.e.
beta-diversity), an important aspect of regional biodiversity, remains a
priority for ecological research. beta-diversity and its components can
provide insights into the processes generating regional biodiversity
patterns. We tested whether environmental filtering or dispersal related
processes predominated along the stream watercourse by analysing the
responses of taxonomic and functional diatom beta-diversity to
environmental and spatial factors.
2. We examined the variation in total beta-diversity and its components
(turnover and nestedness) in benthic diatom species and ecological
guilds (motile, planktonic, low-and high profile) with respect to
watercourse position (up-, mid-and downstream) in 2,182 sites throughout
France. We tested the effects of pure environmental and pure spatial
factors on beta-diversity with partial Mantel tests. Environmental
factors included eight physicochemical variables, while geographical
distances between sites were used as spatial factors. We also correlated
a and c-diversity, and the degree of nestedness (NODF metric) with
environmental variables.
3. Total beta-diversity and its turnover component displayed higher
values upstream than mid-and downstream. The nestedness component
exhibited low values, even when NODF values increased from up-to
downstream. Pure environmental factors were highly significant for
explaining total beta-diversity and turnover regardless of watercourse
position, but pure spatial factors were mostly significant mid-and
downstream, with geographical distance being positively correlated with
beta-diversity. Across sites, nutrient enrichment decreased turnover but
increased the degree of nestedness. Motile and low profile diatoms
comprised the most abundant guilds, but their beta-diversity patterns
varied in an opposite way. The lowest guild beta-diversity was observed
upstream for low profile species, and downstream for motile species.
4. In conclusion, environmental filtering seemed to play a major role in
structuring metacommunities irrespective of site watercourse position.
Filtering promoted strong turnover patterns, especially in disconnected
upstream sites. The greater role of spatial factors mid-and downstream
was consistent with mass effects rather than neutral processes because
these sites had lower total beta-diversity than upstream sites. Motile
species were most strongly affected by mass effects processes, whereas
low profile species were primarily influenced by environmental
conditions. Collectively, these findings suggest that partitioning of
total beta-diversity into its components and the use of diatom
ecological guilds provide a useful framework for assessing the
mechanisms underlying metacommunity patterns along the stream
watercourse.},

abstract = {High-resolution animal movement data are becoming increasingly
available, yet having a multitude of empirical trajectories alone does
not allow us to easily predict animal movement. To answer ecological and
evolutionary questions at a population level, quantitative estimates of
a species' potential to link patches or populations are of importance.
We introduce an approach that combines movement-informed simulated
trajectories with an environment-informed estimate of the trajectories'
plausibility to derive connectivity. Using the example of bar-headed
geese we estimated migratory connectivity at a landscape level
throughout the annual cycle in their native range.
We used tracking data of bar-headed geese to develop a multi-state
movement model and to estimate temporally explicit habitat suitability
within the species' range. We simulated migratory movements between
range fragments, and calculated a measure we called route viability. The
results are compared to expectations derived from published literature.
Simulated migrations matched empirical trajectories in key
characteristics such as stopover duration. The viability of the
simulated trajectories was similar to that of the empirical
trajectories. We found that, overall, the migratory connectivity was
higher within the breeding than in wintering areas, corroborating
previous findings for this species.
We show how empirical tracking data and environmental information can be
fused for meaningful predictions of animal movements throughout the year
and even outside the spatial range of the available data. Beyond
predicting migratory connectivity, our framework will prove useful for
modelling ecological processes facilitated by animal movement, such as
seed dispersal or disease ecology.},

abstract = {1. Salt, primarily NaCl, is commonly used to de-ice winter roads. The
usage of road salt is steadily increasing as the area of urbanised land
expands, and chloride concentrations in many lakes and flowing waters
near roads have been steadily increasing through time. In some
waterbodies, these concentrations are reaching levels that are toxic to
freshwater organisms, such as zooplankton which are integral to the
structure and function of freshwater communities.
2. We currently have a poor understanding of the impact of road salt
contamination on zooplankton communities, and particularly the variation
in response among lakes. Zooplankton communities differ in factors that
could influence the impacts of elevated chloride, such as local species
composition, exposure history and regional connectivity. Assessing and
predicting how increasing road salt usage affects natural, freshwater
zooplankton communities requires studies that investigate how
communities vary in the impacts of elevated chloride, and in their
response to dispersal
3. We conducted a field mesocosm experiment that examined the effects of
salt (NaCI) addition on two different zooplankton communities, which
were also subjected to repeated introductions of zooplankton dispersers
from the regional species pool. These treatments allowed us to determine
whether communities differed in the impacts of salt, and how the effects
of salt differed between communities that did and did not receive
zooplankton dispersers.
4. We found variation in the effects of salt and dispersal between our
experimental communities. For one lake community, salt drove zooplankton
species composition towards dominance by littoral cladocerans.
Zooplankton dispersal into this community ameliorated these impacts of
salt by returning species composition to a state more similar to our
``Control{''} communities. Conversely, for the other lake community,
salt alone had minimal effects on zooplankton, while the combination of
salt and dispersal led to declines in adult copepods.
5. Our experiment found that the impacts of salt varied between two
zooplankton communities, causing a range of negative, positive and
neutral community effects, and that dispersal from the regional species
pool could serve as an ameliorating or exacerbating influence. Efforts
to understand and predict the impacts of road salt on freshwater
communities would therefore benefit from an evaluation of the potential
role played by local (e.g., exposure history and biotic interactions)
and regional (e.g., connectivity to possible sources of immigrants

depth use of individuals is mainly driven by sea temperature and (c)
personality is a significant predictor of home range changes in the

pool of plant species and are hotspots of biodiversity. Climatically,
they can be zoned into montane climates at mid-altitudes and tropical
alpine climates above the tree line. Around half of the tropical alpine
species belong to plant lineages with a temperate ancestry, although
these regions are often geographically distant. We test the hypothesis
that these temperate lineages are pre-adapted to the tropical alpine
climate.
Location: New World, with a focus on tropical alpine Andes.
Time period: Miocene to present.
Major taxa studied: Flowering plants.
Methods: We build multidimensional environmental models representing the
full space of New World climates. We quantify the environmental
similarity between the tropical alpine ecosystem and those of potential
source areas, while correcting for regional differences by kernel
density smoothers. Based on spatial observations of the genus Hypericum
(St John's Wort), we quantify niche overlap and test for niche
conservatism following intercontinental dispersal using density-weighted
nonparametric tests. A dated species tree, biogeographical estimation,
multi-optima Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models and model selection approaches
are used to test for niche shifts during establishment in the tropical
alpine Andes.
Results: The tropical alpine ecosystem is isolated by its climate from
adjacent regions and is climatically similar to temperate lowland biomes
of both hemispheres. Niche conservatism is evident in the study group,
except in the tropical alpine lineage that is characterized by niche
expansion and shifts in temperature optima.
Main conclusions: Our results reject the pre-adaptation hypothesis and
instead suggest pronounced niche evolution during colonization of
tropical alpine ecosystems. Establishment involved substantial niche
shifts, mainly in temperature-related variables, and resulted in a
tremendous proliferation of species in the newly invaded tropical alpine
ecosystem.},

victims on major roads was significantly higher than on other road

contributed significantly to the spatial clustering of owl mortality. We
conclude that in years when prey availability in the agricultural fields

best option to reduce owl traffic victims is to improve the quality of
farmland as foraging areas, and secondly to make design adjustments at
major junctions to reduce owl-traffic collisions.},

considering the same dispersal threshold, species able to move more
easily through the matrix showed higher umbrella performance than those
for which the matrix offered greater resistance.ConclusionsThe
connectivity umbrella is not a static feature that depends only on the

The strength of the interactions between a given plant species and different frugivore guilds (e.g., seed dispersers, seed predators) often vary in space due to changes in plant extrinsic factors (e.g., frugivore abundances) and plant traits (e.g., fruit size and reward). By reciprocally translocating Pyrus bourgaeana ripe fruits representative of five Mediterranean localities during 2 consecutive years, we experimentally quantified guild-specific variations among populations in frugivory strength, while accounted for plant-intrinsic and- extrinsic factors. Though overall fruit removal did not differ among localities, there were strong guild-specific differences in fruit removal strength. Fruit removal by pulp feeders, seed dispersers, and fruit predators varied among populations up to 8.5-, 5.6-, and 4.0-folds, respectively. These strong variations seemed mediated by changes in frugivore relative abundances rather than on availability of alternative fruits. As expected, all fruit traits considered (e.g., fruit size, pulp amount) markedly varied among tree populations. However, no frugivore guild showed preference for fruits from any locality, suggesting that fruit traits did not contribute much to differences in frugivory strength among populations. Since the functional diverse frugivore guilds played contrasting roles in P. bourgaeana dynamics (e.g., seed dispersal vs. seed predation), our study highlights the importance of accounting for functional diversity in frugivore guilds when estimating spatial variations in the strength of seed dispersal. This investigation also illustrates a neglected but widely applicable experimental approach to identify the relative importance of extrinsic factors and fruit traits in mediating fruit-frugivore interactions.},

abstract = {Parasite distributions depend on the local environment in which host
infection occurs, and the surrounding landscape over which hosts move
and transport their parasites. Although host and landscape effects on
parasite prevalence and spatial distribution are difficult to observe
directly, estimation of such relationships is necessary for
understanding the spread of infections and parasite-habitat
associations. Although parasite distributions are necessarily nested
within host distributions, direct environmental influences on local
infection or parasite effects on host dispersal could lead to distinct
landscape or habitat relationships relative to their hosts. Our aim was
to determine parasite spatial structure across a contiguous prairie by
statistical modeling of parasite-landscape relationships combined with
analysis of population genetic structure. We sampled northern leopard
frogs (Lithobates pipiens) and wood frogs (L. sylvaticus) for
host-specific lung nematodes (Rhabdias ranae and R. bakeri;
respectively) across the Sheyenne National Grassland in southeastern
North Dakota and developed primers for 13 microsatellite loci for
Rhabdias. The two Rhabdias species exhibited different correlations with
landscape characteristics that conformed with that of their hosts,
indicating transmission is driven by host ecology, probably density, and
not directly by the environment. There was evidence for localized,
patchy spatial genetic structure, but no broader-scale geographic
patterns, indicating no barriers to host and parasite dispersal.
Nematodes cohabitating in an individual frog were most genetically
similar. Worms within the same wetland were also genetically similar,
indicating localized transmission and resulting wetland-scale patchiness
are not completely obscured by broad-scale host-parasite dispersal.
Beyond individual wetlands, we found no evidence of genetic
isolation-by-distance or patchiness at the landscape-scale.},

abstract = {Although agricultural lands hold a small fraction of the biodiversity of
natural ecosystems, their sheer size and proximity to remaining natural
habitats make them an important target for biodiversity conservation.
Non-crop areas, including remnant natural habitats and field margins,
often increase biodiversity in agricultural areas, but the importance of
cropland heterogeneity (either compositional, the number of crop types,
or configurational, their spatial arrangement) is more controversial.
Greater knowledge is also needed about agroecosystems in biodiverse
areas in the tropics where there are more, smaller-scale farms. We laid
out a network of 73 randomly selected 100 m-radius sites in an
agricultural area near Nanning, Guangxi Province. Here rice and
sugarcane are the major crops, but we encountered a total of
\textbackslash{}45 less dominant crops. At each site we measured the
diversity of herbaceous plants in 10 1-m(2) plots placed in uncultivated
areas over two summers (2016-2017). The analysis focused on relating
plant diversity, for the whole community and for specific categories of
species (e.g., native species, animal-dispersed species), with the (a)
extent of agricultural land cover, (b) compositional crop heterogeneity
(the number and evenness of crop types), (c) length of field margins, a
component of configurational crop heterogeneity, all measured at the 100
m-radius local scale, and (d) another measure of agricultural land
cover, measured at the 500 m-radius landscape scale. We found that
agricultural land cover at the local scale had a strong negative effect.
Contrastingly, its effect at the landscape scale was positive and more
moderate. The contrast among scales may be due to the quality of our
information varying between scales; the dominance of the local scale may
be due to the generally low dispersal abilities of herbaceous plants, as
reported in other studies. Field margin had a positive effect for
native, and especially animal-dispersed species, and may act as an
important component of configurational crop heterogeneity, increasing
the connectivity among patches of different land-use types, especially
for species that disperse using animal movement. Crop compositional
heterogeneity had no detectable effect for the whole community or for
any species category. Our results confirm that the protection of
non-crop areas and configurational crop heterogeneity (i.e., field
margins) is as important for herbaceous plant diversity and composition
in this tropical landscape, as it is elsewhere. (C) 2018 Published by

abstract = {1. Although a key demographic trait determining the spatial dynamics of wild populations, dispersal is notoriously difficult to estimate in the field. Indeed, dispersal distances obtained from the monitoring of marked individuals typically lead to biased estimations of dispersal kernels as a consequence of (i) restricted spatial scale of the study areas compared to species potential dispersal and (ii) heterogeneity in marking and observation efforts and therefore in detection probability across space. 2. Here, we propose a novel method to circumvent these issues that does not require data on observation effort per se, to correct for the variability in detection of marked individuals across space. Observed dispersal events were weighted by the distribution of departure points and an eroded spatial window approach was applied so as to deal with border effect. We conducted a set of simulations which indicated that our method was successful in correcting the effect of spatially heterogeneous detectability and produce unbiased dispersal kernels. 3. We applied this method to a real dataset on the Montagu's harrier (> 5,000 chicks tagged), providing c. 6,000 resightings collected in entire France by a network of 1,200 volunteers within a citizen-science programme. The median dispersal distance observed was 32 km (range: 0.1-627 km). Once corrected for spatial heterogeneity in marking and observation efforts and border effect, the modelled dispersal kernel indicated a median dispersal distance of 78-123 km depending on the spatial scale considered (constrained within French borders or not, respectively). 4. Synthesis and applications: The current rise of citizen-science programmes is likely to stretch our estimate of the ecologically relevant spatial scale at which dispersal takes place for many taxa. Our method is particularly suited for such large-scale data that typically suffer from high spatial heterogeneity in marking and observation efforts and offers the possibility to derive unbiased dispersal kernels, a key component for modelling population dynamics and species distribution in a context of environmental change. Currently, our method assumes homogeneity in both habitat and dispersal behaviour across individuals. We discuss, however, how to relax these hypotheses to further investigate the effect of, e.g. local conspecific density or habitat quality on dispersal propensity.},

abstract = {Aim: We review the works of three pre-Darwinian authorsAlexander von
Humboldt, Augustin de Candolle and Alphonse de Candolle. Contrary to
what other historiographers have claimed, we think that their works were
not merely descriptive, nor did they adhere strictly to the inductivist
model. Furthermore, the patterns described by these authors are still
being studied extensively in biogeography.
Method: We analyse the main concepts provided by these authors on the
spatial patterns of biodiversity, and discuss how they served to
construct the conceptual framework of contemporary biogeography.
Results: In the early 19th century, secular naturalists began
postulating explanations supported by empirical evidence and based on
physical causes. The studied authors were extremely cautious when
proposing hypotheses, considering that any statement not based on
empirical evidence was mere conjecture. When we analyse the way they
developed explanations, it seems evident that they were rather closer to
deductive thought than to the orthodox inductivist model. With the rise
of Darwinian evolutionism, naturalists lost interest in the spatial
patterns of life and began constructing dynamic models where dispersal
of individual lineages from northern centres of origin was proposed to
explain their current distribution. Paradoxically, even though the
evolutionary paradigm soon proved its great explanatory power, it
simultaneously promoted a large number of studies in which speculation
prevailed.
Main conclusions: Even though the practices and methods of current
biogeography have changed substantially, the studied patterns are still
the same: (1) geographical gradients of richness and biotic replacement,
(2) spatial gradients of functional groups, (3) geographical variation
of the phenotype, (4) geographical patterns of expansion-differentiation
of single lineages and (5) biogeographical homology. The studied authors
not only described rigorously biogeographical patterns, but also
proposed explanations about them and even sometimes tested them based on
empirical evidence, going beyond the prevalent inductivist canon.},

scat decay rate duration for Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii, in
Kanyawara, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We used two methods: (1)
multiple visits to obtain prospective decay rates (PDR) (N = 96 scats)
and (2) a novel approach of time-lapse photography (TLP) (N = 17 scats).
Most of the visited scats (67%) decayed in <= 24 hr, and median decay
rate duration from photographic documentation was 18 hr. Using
regression analyses, we tested 11 covariables to determine predictors
for decay rate duration. Greater volume of scat and reduced levels of
diurnal dung beetle activity were positively associated with longer
decay rate duration. Given a high prevalence of dung beetle activity
(88% of scats), particularly within 3 hr post-defaecation, we suggest
the use of the alternative term, disappearance rate of scats. With a
rapid disappearance rate, scat count surveys of unhabituated chimpanzees
are challenging; further work is then needed for Pan spp. to determine
spatial and temporal differences at intra- and inter-species level.},

abstract = {Models of dispersal for response to global climate change can refer to theory on traveling waves developed for invasions. The relevance of this theory may depend on its density- versus habitat dependence, but it has not considered environmental gradients nor related feedbacks. An agent based simulation model (ABM) for a plant species or vegetation type is developed here, focusing on properties of traveling waves. The ABM simulated no-tailed, thin-tailed, and fat-tailed dispersal kernels (random uniform, Gaussian, and Cauchy kernels, respectively). Probabilities were based on either population density or habitat, and for the latter as homogeneous or on a gradient, and if a gradient positive feedback from populations to the habitat was added to represent process at ecotones such as a positive feedback switch or the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH) feedback. The uniform and Gaussian kernels produced traveling waves with constant speed, but the fat-tailed Cauchy kernel produced traveling waves that accelerated and also flattened as the low-probability. portion of wave accelerated fastest. On a gradient, when populations approached the limit of habitability the waves steepened and stopped traveling. The effect of SGH feedback on traveling wave slopes depends on the dispersal kernel. With strong facilitation on the gradient, greater variety of spatial patterns were able to develop among the replicate simulations of the fat-tailed kernel when it flattened to a greater spatial extent of low probability presence. In addition to the heterogeneity of the habitat and its modification by facilitation, the details of dispersal can also affect the feedback between spatial pattern and the establishment process that will affect the rate of advance of a species or an ecotone into new territory.

abstract = {With continued global changes, such as climate change, biodiversity
loss, and habitat fragmentation, the need for assessment of long-term
population dynamics and population monitoring of threatened species is
growing. One powerful way to estimate population size and dynamics is
through capture-recapture methods. Spatial capture (SCR) models for open
populations make efficient use of capture-recapture data, while being
robust to design changes. Relatively few studies have implemented open
SCR models, and to date, very few have explored potential issues in
defining these models. We develop a series of simulation studies to
examine the effects of the state-space definition and
between-primary-period movement models on demographic parameter
estimation. We demonstrate the implications on a 10-year camera-trap
study of tigers in India. The results of our simulation study show that
movement biases survival estimates in open SCR models when little is
known about between-primary-period movements of animals. The size of the
state-space delineation can also bias the estimates of survival in
certain cases.We found that both the state-space definition and the
between-primary-period movement specification affected survival
estimates in the analysis of the tiger dataset (posterior mean estimates
of survival ranged from 0.71 to 0.89). In general, we suggest that open
SCR models can provide an efficient and flexible framework for long-term
monitoring of populations; however, in many cases, realistic modeling of

abstract = {Despite decades of research on the species-pool concept and the recent
explosion of interest in trait-based frameworks in ecology and
biogeography, surprisingly little is known about how spatial and
temporal changes in species-pool functional diversity (SPFD) influence
biodiversity and the processes underlying community assembly. Current
trait-based frameworks focus primarily on community assembly from a
static regional species pool, without considering how spatial or
temporal variation in SPFD alters the relative importance of
deterministic and stochastic assembly processes. Likewise, species-pool
concepts primarily focus on how the number of species in the species
pool influences local biodiversity. However, species pools with similar
richness can vary substantially in functional-trait diversity, which can
strongly influence community assembly and biodiversity responses to
environmental change. Here, we integrate recent advances in community
ecology, trait-based ecology, and biogeography to provide a more
comprehensive framework that explicitly considers how variation in SPFD,
among regions and within regions through time, influences the relative
importance of community assembly processes and patterns of biodiversity.
First, we provide a brief overview of the primary ecological and
evolutionary processes that create differences in SPFD among regions and
within regions through time. We then illustrate how SPFD may influence
fundamental processes of local community assembly (dispersal, ecological
drift, niche selection). Higher SPFD may increase the relative
importance of deterministic community assembly when greater functional
diversity in the species pool increases niche selection across
environmental gradients. In contrast, lower SPFD may increase the
relative importance of stochastic community assembly when high
functional redundancy in the species pool increases the influence of
dispersal history or ecological drift. Next, we outline experimental and
observational approaches for testing the influence of SPFD on assembly
processes and biodiversity. Finally, we highlight applications of this
framework for restoration and conservation. This species-pool functional
diversity framework has the potential to advance our understanding of
how local- and regional-scale processes jointly influence patterns of
biodiversity across biogeographic regions, changes in biodiversity
within regions over time, and restoration outcomes and conservation
efforts in ecosystems altered by environmental change.},

Yet, limited sample sizes and variation in space and habitat use across regions and life stages may compromise robustness of behavioral analyses and subsequent conservation plans. Here, we assessed variation in (i) home range sizes, (ii) home range selection, and (iii) fine-scale resource selection of white storks across breeding status and regions and test model transferability. Three study areas were chosen within the Central German breeding grounds ranging from agricultural to fluvial and marshland. We monitored GPS-locations of 62 adult white storks equipped with solar-charged GPS/3D-acceleration (ACC) transmitters in 2013-2014. Home range sizes were estimated using minimum convex polygons. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess home range selection and fine-scale resource selection by relating the home ranges and foraging sites to Corine habitat variables and normalized difference vegetation index in a presence/pseudo-absence design. We found strong variation in home range sizes across breeding stages with significantly larger home ranges in non-breeding compared to breeding white storks, but no variation between regions. Home range selection models had high explanatory power and well predicted overall density of Central German white stork breeding pairs. Also, they showed good transferability across regions and breeding status although variable importance varied considerably. Fine-scale resource selection models showed low explanatory power. Resource preferences differed both across breeding status and across regions, and model transferability was poor. Our results indicate that habitat selection of wild animals may vary considerably within and between populations, and is highly scale dependent. Thereby, home range scale analyses show higher robustness whereas fine-scale resource selection is not easily predictable and not transferable across life stages and regions. Such variation may compromise management decisions when based on data of limited sample size or limited regional coverage. We thus recommend home range scale analyses and sampling designs that cover diverse regional landscapes and ensure robust estimates of habitat suitability to conserve wild animal populations.},

Using a common bumblebee species from the western United States (Bombus vosnesenskii), we ask whether seasonal decreases in food resources prompt changes in foraging behavior and space use. We employ a unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region. Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on their movement and services. The behavioral shift toward long-distance foraging with seasonal declines in food resources suggests a novel, phenologically directed approach to landscape-level pollinator conservation and greater consideration of late-season floral resources in pollinator habitat management.},

by different environmental conditions experienced by larvae in the
coastal oceanic water before they entered the river, but also by
different migration routes during their marine dispersal. The coastal
water on the eastern side, more turbid and probably trophically richer,
could have induced a better growth of the post-larvae compared to those

concerning the Marsouins River, located East of the island, where

tested to what extent patterns of endemism and phylogenetic diversity of
European dragonfly assemblages are structured by 1) phylogenetic
conservatism of thermal adaptations and 2) differences in the ability of
post-glacial recolonization by species adapted to running waters (lotic)
and still waters (lentic). We investigated patterns of dragonfly
diversity using digital distribution maps and a phylogeny of 122
European dragonfly species, which we constructed by combining taxonomic
and molecular data. We calculated total taxonomic distinctiveness and
mean pairwise distances across 4192 50 x 50 km equal-area grid cells as
measures of phylogenetic diversity. We compared species richness with
corrected weighted endemism and standardized effect sizes of mean
pairwise distances or residuals of total taxonomic distinctiveness to
identify areas with higher or lower phylogenetic diversity than expected
by chance. Broken-line regression was used to detect breakpoints in
diversity-latitude relationships. Dragonfly species richness peaked in
central Europe, whereas endemism and phylogenetic diversity decreased
from warm areas in the south-west to cold areas in the north-east and
with an increasing proportion of lentic species. Except for species
richness, all measures of diversity were consistently higher in formerly
unglaciated areas south of the 0 degrees C isotherm during the Last
Glacial Maximum than in formerly glaciated areas. These results indicate
that the distributions of dragonfly species in Europe were shaped by
both phylogenetic conservatism of thermal adaptations and differences
between lentic and lotic species in the ability of post-glacial
recolonization/dispersal in concert with the climatic history of the
continent. The complex diversity patterns of European dragonflies
provide an example of how integrating climatic and evolutionary history
with contemporary ecological data can improve our understanding of the

theoretical schemata to qualitatively interrogate the complicated
structure of part of a real agroecosystem. The three schemata are first,
local dynamics translated into intransitive oscillators through spatial
movement, second, stabilizing the system through spatial pattern, and
third, formation of a self-organized spatial pattern. The real system is
the well-studied autonomous pest control in the coffee agroecosystem, in
which five insect species (one of which is a pest) are involved in
creating a complex community structure that keeps the pest under control
(the five species are an ant, Azteca sericeasur, a phorid fly
parasitoid, Pseudacteon sp., a hymenopteran parasitoid, Coccophagus sp.,
a beetle predator, Azya orbigera, and the pest itself, the green coffee
scale, Coccus viridis). We use the qualitative framing of the three
theoretical schemata to develop a cellular automata model that casts the
basic predator/prey (natural enemy/pest) system as an intransitive
oscillator, and then explore the interaction of the two basic
predator/prey systems as coupled oscillators within this model
framework. We note that Gause's principle of competitive exclusion is
not violated with this basic framing (i.e., the two control agents
cannot coexist theoretically), but that with a change in the spatial
structure of the background habitat, coexistence can be maintained
through the tradeoff between regional dispersal and local consumption.
Finally, we explore how the other oscillator in the system (the ant and
its phorid parasitoid) can act as a pilot system, creating the spatial
structure in which the other two oscillators operate, but only in the
context of disjoint time frames (between the two control agents and the
pilot subsystem).},

abstract = {This study aimed to clarify the mechanisms that structure zooplankton
communities in a lowland river network. Fourteen stations on the Scheldt
upper river basin (France/Belgium) were sampled during 4 campaigns in
2014-2015. Firstly, a niche analysis of zooplankton taxa was conducted
for April and September 2014 using the outlying mean index (OMI)
ordination technique. Then, application of Hutchinson's niche and of
Hubbell's neutral theories to zooplankton community of the river network
was tested for April and June 2015. We subsequently tested whether the
taxa ecological preferences revealed were reflected in the April and
June 2015 zooplankton spatial distributions. In April 2015, zooplankton
community dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis distance) was more influenced by
environmental conditions than by hydrological distance, in accordance
with niche theory. In June 2015, a stronger influence of neutral
processes was suggested by an important role of hydrology. In 2014
samples, 17 over 32 taxa presented significant marginality relying on
the considered environmental parameters. This specialization was
reflected in the 2015 community patterns, particularly in April. During
this month, local environmental parameters were more influencing than
hydrology, probably related to a higher environmental heterogeneity than
in June 2015. Although zooplankters are often considered to be
generalists and opportunists, mainly dependent of river hydrology, these
results showed that even for passive dispersers in highly connected
systems, niche processes contribute to community structuring by local
filtering. Determination of species niche parameters is thus important
to understand observed community patterns but also changes in species
distribution relative to environmental and hydrological changes.},

abstract = {Ediacaran fossil communities consist of the oldest macroscopic
eukaryotic organisms. Increased size (height) is hypothesized to be
driven by competition for water column resources, leading to
vertical/epifaunal tiering and morphological innovations such as stems.
Using spatial analyses, we find no correlation between tiering and
resource competition, and that stemmed organisms are not tiered.
Instead, we find that height is correlated with greater offspring
dispersal, demonstrating the importance of colonization potential over
resource competition.},
